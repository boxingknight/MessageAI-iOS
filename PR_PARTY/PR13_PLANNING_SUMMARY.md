## What We're Building

### 3 Core Features

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| Group Creation & Setup | 2-3h | CRITICAL | Users can create groups with 3-50 participants |
| Group Messaging & Display | 1-2h | CRITICAL | Messages deliver to all, sender names show |
| Group Management | 2-3h | HIGH | View participants, add/remove, admin permissions |

**Total Time:** 5-6 hours (realistic based on detailed planning)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Extend Existing Conversation Model
**Choice:** Add group fields to existing Conversation model (vs creating separate GroupConversation model)  
**Rationale:**
- Reuse 80% of existing code (ChatService methods, ViewModels, Views)
- Consistent API for 1-on-1 and group operations
- Simpler Firestore queries (single collection)
- Faster MVP implementation
- SwiftUI-friendly (same models, conditional rendering)

**Impact:** Will add optional fields `groupName`, `groupPhotoURL`, `admins` to Conversation model. Conditional logic in views based on `isGroup` flag.

---

### Decision 2: Sheet-Based Creation Flow
**Choice:** Multi-sheet flow (ParticipantSelection ‚Üí GroupSetup ‚Üí ChatView)  
**Rationale:**
- iOS-native pattern (users expect sheets)
- Clear hierarchy and dismissible steps
- Consistent with existing contact selection (PR #8)
- Lightweight (doesn't hijack full screen)

**Impact:** Will create 3 new views: ParticipantSelectionView, GroupSetupView, GroupInfoView

---

### Decision 3: Aggregate Read Receipts
**Choice:** Show aggregate status (blue when ALL read) vs per-person detail  
**Rationale:**
- Clean UI in large groups (no clutter)
- Consistent with 1-on-1 UX
- Matches WhatsApp's approach
- MVP-simple (can add detail view in PR #23)

**Impact:** Will extend Message.statusForGroup() method to aggregate deliveredTo and readBy arrays

---

### Decision 4: Multiple Admins Model
**Choice:** Creator + promoted admins (vs creator-only or no admins)  
**Rationale:**
- Flexible (creator can delegate)
- Resilient (group survives if creator leaves)
- Real-world pattern (WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Extensible for future permission features

**Impact:** Will add `admins: [String]?` to Conversation, Firestore rules check admin status

---

### Decision 5: 50 Participant MVP Limit
**Choice:** Max 50 participants (vs unlimited or 256)  
**Rationale:**
- Performance-tested scale (Firestore handles 50 well)
- Covers 99% of use cases (95% of groups <20 people)
- MVP-appropriate (can increase in PR #23 with optimizations)
- Manageable Firestore costs

**Impact:** Validation in ChatService.createGroupConversation(), UI shows "X of 50 selected"

---

### Decision 6: Optional Names with Auto-Generation
**Choice:** User can name group, auto-generate if empty  
**Rationale:**
- No friction (don't block creation on naming)
- Always has a display name (never "Unnamed Group" in UI)
- Flexible for power users and casual users
- WhatsApp pattern

**Impact:** Auto-generation logic: "Alice, Bob" or "Alice, Bob, Charlie, and 5 others"

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline (5-6 hours)

```
Hour 0-1.5: Phase 1 - Group Data Model & Service
‚îú‚îÄ Update Conversation model with group fields
‚îú‚îÄ Add statusForGroup() to Message model
‚îî‚îÄ Implement 8 ChatService group methods

Hour 1.5-3: Phase 2 & 3 - Group Creation UI
‚îú‚îÄ Create ParticipantSelectionView (multi-select)
‚îú‚îÄ Integrate with ChatListView (action sheet)
‚îú‚îÄ Create GroupViewModel (logic layer)
‚îî‚îÄ Create GroupSetupView (name input)

Hour 3-4: Phase 4 - Group Message Display
‚îú‚îÄ Update MessageBubbleView (sender names)
‚îú‚îÄ Implement aggregate read receipts
‚îî‚îÄ Test message delivery to multiple recipients

Hour 4-5.5: Phase 5 - Group Management
‚îú‚îÄ Create GroupInfoView (participant list)
‚îú‚îÄ Implement admin actions (add/remove/promote)
‚îú‚îÄ Implement leave/delete group
‚îî‚îÄ Integrate in ChatView (tap title to open)

Hour 5.5-6: Phase 6 - Security & Testing
‚îú‚îÄ Update Firestore security rules
‚îú‚îÄ Deploy to Firebase
‚îú‚îÄ Manual testing (10+ scenarios)
‚îî‚îÄ Bug fixes and documentation
```

### Key Principle
**"Test after EACH phase"** - Don't move to next phase until current phase works. Group chat is complex‚Äîverify each step before building on it.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Group creation: <2 seconds from tap to ChatView
- [ ] Message delivery to 10 participants: <3 seconds
- [ ] Message delivery to 50 participants: <5 seconds
- [ ] GroupInfoView loads: <500ms
- [ ] Scroll performance: 60fps with group messages

### Qualitative
- [ ] Group creation feels effortless (3 taps to create)
- [ ] Sender names are clearly visible in group messages
- [ ] Read receipts provide confidence (blue = everyone read)
- [ ] Group management is intuitive (tap title to view/manage)
- [ ] Permissions work correctly (non-admins can't break group)

---

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Performance with 50 Participants üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** Large groups could slow down message delivery and UI  
**Mitigation:**
- LazyVStack for efficient rendering
- Pagination for participant lists (load 20 at a time)
- Firestore query optimization (limit, caching)
- Can reduce to 30 if performance issues
**Status:** Will monitor in testing phase

---

### Risk 2: Aggregate Read Receipt Complexity üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** Logic to aggregate status across many participants is tricky  
**Mitigation:**
- Conservative approach (show delivered until ALL read)
- Clear unit tests for aggregation logic
- Test with 3, 10, 50 participants
- Can add detail view later (tap to see per-person)
**Status:** Well-documented, will test thoroughly

---

### Risk 3: Admin Permission Edge Cases üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** Complex scenarios (last admin leaves, non-admin tries to remove, etc.)  
**Mitigation:**
- Firestore rules enforce permissions (security layer)
- UI checks permissions (UX layer)
- Comprehensive test scenarios (#11-13)
- Auto-promote longest-standing member if needed
**Status:** Documented in open questions, will handle in code

---

### Risk 4: Notification Spam in Large Groups üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** 50 people √ó 10 messages/day = 500 notifications (user annoyance)  
**Mitigation:**
- Defer to PR #17 (Push Notifications)
- Will add per-group mute settings
- Summary notifications: "5 new messages in Weekend Plans"
**Status:** Not PR #13 scope, documented for PR #17

---

### Risk 5: Firestore Cost (Large Groups) üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** 50 participants listening to same conversation = 50 reads per message  
**Mitigation:**
- Firestore efficiently handles this (single document, multiple listeners)
- Free tier: 50K reads/day = 1,000 messages to 50 people (sufficient MVP)
- Can optimize with caching if needed
**Status:** Acceptable for MVP

---

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Model Changes
**Why:** Get foundation right first. If Conversation model is correct, everything else follows. Spend 30 minutes here, save 2 hours debugging later.

### Tip 2: Test Multi-Select UI in Preview
**Why:** ParticipantSelectionView is complex (checkmarks, Set<String>, search). Test in SwiftUI Preview before integrating. Saves simulator restarts.

### Tip 3: Use Real Users for Testing
**Why:** Create 5+ test users in Firebase Auth before starting. Testing group chat requires multiple accounts. Don't use @example.com (won't receive emails).

### Tip 4: Commit After Every Phase
**Why:** Group chat touches 13 files. If something breaks, you want a clean commit to roll back to. Commit message: `[PR #13] Phase X complete: [description]`

### Tip 5: Test Firestore Rules First
**Why:** Deploy rules immediately after writing them. Test with Firebase Console Rules Playground. Saves debugging "permission denied" errors later.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ‚úÖ You have 6+ hours available (don't rush this)
- ‚úÖ PR #1-11 complete (solid messaging foundation)
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable with complex UI (sheets, navigation, multi-select)
- ‚úÖ You want feature-complete MVP (groups are essential)
- ‚úÖ Excited to build the "hard stuff" (permissions, multi-user, aggregation)

### No-Go If:
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<5 hours available)
- ‚ùå Real-time messaging not working (PR #10 incomplete)
- ‚ùå Message status broken (PR #11 incomplete)
- ‚ùå Overwhelmed by complexity (totally valid!)
- ‚ùå Prefer to ship 1-on-1 MVP first (good strategy)

**Decision Aid:**

If **Yes** to 4+ "Go If" ‚Üí **BUILD IT!** You're ready.

If **Yes** to 2+ "No-Go If" ‚Üí **DEFER TO DAY 2.** Ship 1-on-1 MVP first, add groups when you have more time.

**Recommendation:** If you're in flow and PRs #1-11 went well, keep momentum and build it. Group chat is the natural next step.
