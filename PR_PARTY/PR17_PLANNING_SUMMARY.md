## What We're Building

### Priority Highlighting Feature: AI-Powered Urgent Message Detection

**User Story:**
Sarah (busy parent) receives 100+ messages/day in school parent group. When "Pickup changed to 2pm TODAY" arrives buried in casual chat, the app detects urgency and highlights it in red with 🚨 badge so she sees it before it's too late.

**Core Features:**
1. **Automatic Detection:** Every new message analyzed for urgency
2. **3-Level Classification:** Critical (🔴 red), High (🟡 orange), Normal (no indicator)
3. **Visual Hierarchy:** Colored borders + emoji badges + priority banner
4. **Smart Technology:** Hybrid approach (keyword filter + GPT-4 context analysis)
5. **Cost-Effective:** 80% of messages analyzed free (<100ms), 20% use GPT-4 (~$0.002/call)

**Value Proposition:**
"Never miss an urgent message buried in 100+ daily group chat messages. AI flags what needs attention NOW vs what can wait."

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Hybrid Detection (Keywords → GPT-4)
**Choice:** Use keyword filter first (80% of messages), GPT-4 only for potential urgent messages (20%)

**Rationale:**
- Cost-effective: 80% reduction in GPT-4 API calls (~$1-2/month/user vs $10-20)
- Fast: Keyword check <100ms vs GPT-4 2-3s
- Accurate: GPT-4 analyzes ambiguous cases with full conversation context
- Scalable: Handles 100+ messages/day per user efficiently

**Impact:**
- Gain: Best of both worlds (cost + accuracy)
- Lose: Might miss creatively-phrased urgent messages without keywords (mitigated by broad keyword list)

---

### Decision 2: 3-Level Priority System (Critical/High/Normal)
**Choice:** Three urgency levels instead of 2 (binary) or 5 (over-granular)

**Rationale:**
- User clarity: Red = act now, Yellow = pay attention soon, No color = normal
- Visual hierarchy: Users can scan chat and instantly distinguish levels
- AI accuracy: 3-way classification more accurate than 5-way
- Matches real urgency: Critical = time-sensitive + consequences, High = important not emergency, Normal = everything else

**Impact:**
- Gain: Clear visual distinction, easier AI classification, matches user mental model
- Lose: Less granularity than 5-level (but 5-level was overkill)

---

### Decision 3: Border + Badge Visual Pattern
**Choice:** Colored border around message bubble + emoji badge below

**Rationale:**
- Visibility: Colored border catches eye when scanning
- Clarity: Badge confirms urgency type (🚨 critical, ⚠️ high)
- Accessibility: Works for colorblind users (color + icon)
- Non-intrusive: Doesn't block message text or reduce readability
- Industry precedent: Similar to Slack "Important" messages, Gmail priority inbox

**Impact:**
- Gain: Maximum visibility + accessibility
- Lose: Slightly more visual clutter (but only for urgent messages, which is the point)

---

### Decision 4: Collapsible Banner + Global Tab
**Choice:** Two UI surfaces - in-chat collapsible banner + global urgent messages tab

**Rationale:**
- In-context: Banner shows urgent messages within conversation (doesn't lose context)
- Global view: Tab shows all urgent messages across all chats (one place to see everything)
- User control: Banner collapses when user addresses urgent items (regains screen space)
- Discoverability: Banner auto-expands on new critical message

**Impact:**
- Gain: Best of both worlds (in-context + global view)
- Lose: Two UI elements to maintain (but serve different user needs)

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline: 2-3 Hours Total

**Phase Breakdown:**

| Phase | Task | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Cloud Function (keyword + GPT-4) | 45 min | Detection logic |
| 2 | iOS Models (PriorityLevel enum, AIMetadata) | 15 min | Data structures |
| 3 | AIService.detectPriority() | 20 min | iOS wrapper |
| 4 | Enhanced MessageBubbleView | 30 min | Border + badge UI |
| 5 | PriorityBannerView | 30 min | In-chat urgent section |
| 6 | ChatViewModel integration | 30 min | Detection triggers |
| 7 | Testing & validation | 30 min | Accuracy + performance |
| **Total** | | **2.5-3.5h** | |

**Key Principle:** "False positives OK, false negatives NOT OK" - tune for safety, not perfection. Better to flag 20 normal messages as urgent than miss 1 urgent message.

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: False Negatives (Missing Urgent Messages) 🔴 CRITICAL
**Issue:** AI fails to detect urgent message ("Pickup changed to 2pm") and parent misses it

**Likelihood:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL (defeats purpose, causes real-world problems)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Broad keyword list (over-capture rather than under-capture)
- Time-sensitive regex patterns ("at X pm today", "by tonight")
- GPT-4 fallback for context analysis
- Low threshold for "normal" classification (confidence >0.8 required)
- User feedback mechanism ("Was this urgent?" for continuous improvement)

**Status:** 🟡 Monitored - Will tune based on real-world testing

---

### Risk 2: False Positives (Normal Messages Flagged as Urgent) 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Normal message gets red border ("Thanks everyone!" → critical)

**Likelihood:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Impact:** 🟢 LOW (annoying but not dangerous, users see extra red borders)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- GPT-4 context analysis reduces false positives
- User can dismiss false urgents (trains system over time)
- Low confidence urgents shown as "high" not "critical"
- Accept some false positives (better safe than sorry)

**Status:** 🟢 Acceptable trade-off (false positives OK, false negatives NOT OK)

---

### Risk 3: High API Costs (GPT-4 on Every Message) 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** GPT-4 called on every message, costs spike to $10-20/month/user

**Likelihood:** 🟢 LOW (hybrid approach prevents this)  
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM (unsustainable costs)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Keyword filter catches 80% as normal (free, <100ms)
- GPT-4 only for 20% with potential urgency
- Rate limiting (100 req/hour/user from PR#14)
- 5-minute caching (same message, instant response)
- Monitor Firebase billing, set alerts at $10/day

**Status:** 🟢 Prevented by hybrid approach

---

### Risk 4: Slow Performance (Users Wait for Priority) 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Message display delayed while waiting for priority detection

**Likelihood:** 🟢 LOW  
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM (users frustrated, app feels slow)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Async detection (message appears immediately, priority updates 1-2s later)
- Keyword check first (<100ms) before GPT-4
- Cache results (repeated messages instant)
- Show message immediately, add border when priority detected

**Status:** 🟢 Prevented by async + caching

---

## Hot Tips for Implementation

### Tip 1: Test Keyword Filter Separately First
**Why:** Keyword detection is 80% of the feature and has zero cost. Verify it works before adding GPT-4 complexity.

**How to test:**
```typescript
// In priorityDetection.ts
const result = await keywordBasedDetection("urgent pickup at 2pm today");
console.log(result);
// Expected: { priorityLevel: 'critical', confidence: 0.9 }

const result2 = await keywordBasedDetection("thanks everyone");
console.log(result2);
// Expected: { priorityLevel: 'normal', confidence: 0.85 }
```

---

### Tip 2: Monitor FAST PATH vs SLOW PATH in Logs
**Why:** You want 80% of messages to skip GPT-4 (fast path). If too many go to slow path, costs spike.

**How to monitor:**
```typescript
// In detectPriority()
if (keywordResult.level === 'normal' && keywordResult.confidence > 0.8) {
  console.log('FAST PATH: Skipped GPT-4'); // Should see this 80% of time
  return keywordResult;
}

console.log('SLOW PATH: Calling GPT-4'); // Should see this 20% of time
```

**Check Firebase logs:** `firebase functions:log --only processAI`

---

### Tip 3: False Negatives Are Your Enemy
**Why:** Missing an urgent message is worse than flagging too many. Parents will forgive extra red borders, but not missing "Pickup changed to 2pm TODAY".

**How to prevent:**
- Broad keyword list (include variations: "urgent", "urgency", "urgently")
- Time patterns ("at X pm today", "by tonight", "this morning")
- Low threshold for "normal" (confidence >0.8 required to skip GPT-4)
- GPT-4 as safety net for ambiguous cases

**Test with real messages:** Collect 50 real group chat messages (25 urgent, 25 normal), calculate false negative rate, target <5%.

---

### Tip 4: Start with Border, Add Badge Later
**Why:** Border is the MVP - visually distinct, catches eye. Badge is polish.

**Implementation order:**
1. Get border working (30 min) - RED for critical, ORANGE for high
2. Test border visibility (scan chat, does urgent message stand out?)
3. Add badge (10 min) - 🚨 icon + "Critical" text
4. Test badge clarity (is urgency level obvious?)

This lets you validate core UX before adding polish.

---

### Tip 5: Use Manual Priority Assignment for UI Testing
**Why:** Don't wait for AI to work before testing UI. Manually assign priorities to test messages.

**How to test:**
```swift
// In ChatViewModel or test code
var testMessage = Message(...)
testMessage.aiMetadata = AIMetadata(
    priorityLevel: .critical,
    priorityConfidence: 0.95,
    priorityReason: "Test urgent message"
)
// Now test UI with this message
```

This decouples UI testing from AI functionality.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ You have 2-3 hours available
- ✅ PR#14 (Cloud Functions) is 100% complete
- ✅ OpenAI API key working from PR#15 or PR#16
- ✅ You want a high-impact safety feature
- ✅ You understand hybrid approaches (keyword + AI)

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Time-constrained (<2 hours available)
- ❌ PR#14 not complete (HARD DEPENDENCY)
- ❌ Uncomfortable with AI/ML concepts
- ❌ Want to focus on other features first

**Decision Aid:**
- If you built PR#15 (Calendar Extraction) or PR#16 (Decision Summarization), this follows the same pattern - you can do this!
- If worried about cost: Hybrid approach keeps it low (~$1-2/month/user)
- If concerned about complexity: Keyword detection is 80% of the feature and very simple

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - This is a well-planned, proven approach (hybrid is industry standard)

**Recommendation:** GO! This is a safety feature that solves a real problem and has high viral potential ("This app saved me from late pickup!").
