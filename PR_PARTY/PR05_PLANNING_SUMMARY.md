## What We're Building

### ChatService - The Heart of Messaging

**Core Features** (3-4 hours):

| Feature | Time | Priority | Impact |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| Conversation Management | 45-60 min | HIGH | Create & fetch conversations |
| Message Sending | 60-75 min | CRITICAL | Send messages with optimistic UI |
| Real-Time Listeners | Integrated | CRITICAL | Instant message delivery |
| Status Tracking | 30-45 min | HIGH | Sent/delivered/read receipts |
| Message Queue | 20-30 min | MEDIUM | Retry failed sends |
| Security Rules | 30 min | CRITICAL | Protect user data |

**Total Time:** 3-4 hours

**Complexity:** HIGH
- Async/await extensively
- Real-time listeners with AsyncThrowingStream
- Firestore queries and batch operations
- Error mapping and handling
- Listener lifecycle management

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Service Pattern over Repository Pattern
**Choice:** All chat logic in single ChatService class

**Rationale:**
- Faster to implement for MVP
- Firebase operations tightly coupled to Firestore features
- Can refactor later if needed
- Consistent with AuthService (PR #2)

**Impact:** ~400 line service class with clear sections (manageable)

---

### Decision 2: Real-Time Sync with Snapshot Listeners
**Choice:** Firestore snapshot listeners (not polling)

**Rationale:**
- Built into Firebase
- Real-time by default (1-2 second latency)
- Efficient (only sends changes)
- Offline support included
- Industry standard

**Impact:** Need to carefully manage listener lifecycle to avoid memory leaks

---

### Decision 3: Client-Generated UUID (from PR #4)
**Choice:** Continue using UUID for message IDs

**Rationale:**
- Consistent with PR #4 models
- Enables optimistic UI (instant display)
- Works fully offline
- No collision risk

**Impact:** Firestore accepts custom IDs, so no issues

---

### Decision 4: In-Memory Queue Now, Persistent Later
**Choice:** Simple array for pending messages (PR #5), SwiftData persistence in PR #6

**Rationale:**
- Start simple, iterate later
- Separation of concerns (networking vs persistence)
- Faster to implement and test
- PR #6 adds durability

**Impact:** Messages lost on app restart (acceptable for PR #5, fixed in PR #6)

---

### Decision 5: Batch Status Updates for Read Receipts
**Choice:** Batch update all unread messages at once

**Rationale:**
- More efficient than individual updates
- Firestore optimized for batch operations
- Reduces write costs
- Better UX (mark all as read on conversation open)

**Impact:** Requires careful query to filter only other user's messages

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Phase 1: Foundation (30-45 min)
├─ ChatService class structure
├─ ChatError enum
├─ Error mapping helper
└─ Cleanup methods

Phase 2: Conversations (45-60 min)
├─ createConversation()
└─ fetchConversations() with listener

Phase 3: Messages (60-75 min)
├─ sendMessage() with optimistic UI
├─ uploadMessageToFirestore()
├─ updateConversationLastMessage()
└─ fetchMessages() with listener

Phase 4: Status (30-45 min)
├─ updateMessageStatus()
└─ markAsRead() with batch

Phase 5: Queue (20-30 min)
├─ retryPendingMessages()
└─ getPendingMessages()

Phase 6: Security (30 min)
├─ Write firestore.rules
└─ Deploy to Firebase

Phase 7: Testing (30-45 min)
├─ 8 test scenarios
└─ Bug fixes

Total: 3-4 hours
```

### Key Principles

**1. Optimistic UI First**
- Show message immediately
- Upload in background
- Update status on confirmation

**2. Real-Time by Default**
- Snapshot listeners for all queries
- Yield via AsyncThrowingStream
- Detach on view disappear

**3. Error Handling Everywhere**
- Map Firestore errors to ChatError
- Provide user-friendly messages
- Queue failed sends for retry

**4. Clean Up Properly**
- Store listener references
- Remove on deinit
- Prevent memory leaks

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Message send: < 500ms average
- [ ] Real-time delivery: < 2 seconds
- [ ] Listener setup: < 1 second
- [ ] Works with 100+ messages per conversation

### Qualitative
- [ ] Zero data loss (messages never lost)
- [ ] No duplicate messages
- [ ] Messages in chronological order
- [ ] Listeners clean up without leaks
- [ ] Security rules prevent unauthorized access

### Testing
- [ ] All 8 test scenarios pass
- [ ] Security rules tested and deployed
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Firestore operations confirmed in console

---

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Firestore Listener Memory Leaks 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Listeners not detached cause memory leaks and battery drain

**Mitigation:**
- Store listeners in dictionary with cleanup
- Implement deinit with cleanup()
- Provide manual detach methods
- Test with Instruments

**Status:** Mitigated with proper lifecycle management

---

### Risk 2: Message Duplication 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Same message sent twice or listener triggers duplicate

**Mitigation:**
- UUID ensures global uniqueness
- Firestore doc ID = message ID
- ViewModel deduplication (PR #10)

**Status:** Low risk with UUID approach

---

### Risk 3: Race Conditions 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Multiple rapid sends could interfere

**Mitigation:**
- async/await prevents most races
- Firestore handles concurrency server-side
- Unique IDs for all messages

**Status:** Low risk with async/await

---

### Risk 4: Network Errors During Send 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Message send fails, user unclear what happened

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive error mapping
- Keep failed messages in queue
- Retry mechanism
- Clear error messages

**Status:** Mitigated with queue and retry

---

### Risk 5: Firestore Security Rules 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Rules block legitimate operations

**Mitigation:**
- Test rules with emulator
- Test with multiple users
- Allow status updates from non-senders

**Status:** Low risk with testing

**Overall Risk:** MEDIUM - Complex but well-mitigated

---

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Listeners Early
**Why:** Listeners are the trickiest part. Test that they fire, update correctly, and detach properly. Use console.log liberally!

### Tip 2: Check Firestore Console Constantly
**Why:** Visual confirmation that data is being written correctly. Catch schema mismatches early.

### Tip 3: Commit After Each Phase
**Why:** If something breaks, you can roll back to last working state. Granular commits save hours of debugging.

### Tip 4: Use Firebase Emulator (Optional but Helpful)
**Why:** Test locally without affecting production data. Faster iteration. Can test security rules safely.

### Tip 5: Print Everything
**Why:** Console logs show exactly what's happening with async operations. Remove later but essential for debugging.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ You have 3-4 hours of focused time
- ✅ PR #4 (Core Models) is complete
- ✅ You understand async/await basics
- ✅ Firebase is configured and working
- ✅ You're comfortable with Firestore
- ✅ No critical bugs blocking work

### No-Go If:
- ❌ PR #4 not complete (models required)
- ❌ < 3 hours available (won't finish)
- ❌ Don't understand async/await (learn first)
- ❌ Firebase not working (fix PR #1 first)
- ❌ Critical bugs need attention first

**Decision Aid:**

**If models exist and you have time → BUILD NOW**

This is the most important service. Without it, no messaging. Everything else depends on this.

**If models don't exist → Finish PR #4 first** (only 1-2 hours)

**If unfamiliar with async/await → Study for 30 minutes first**
- Read Swift Concurrency docs
- Practice with simple async function
- Understand AsyncThrowingStream basics
