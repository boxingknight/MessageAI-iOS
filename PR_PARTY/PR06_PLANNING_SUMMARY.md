## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Core Data Over SwiftData

**Choice:** Use Core Data (iOS 16+ compatible)

**Rationale:**
- Our minimum iOS target is 16.0 (set in PR #1)
- SwiftData requires iOS 17.0+ (too restrictive)
- Core Data is mature, well-documented, battle-tested
- Can migrate to SwiftData later if we raise min iOS version
- Broader device compatibility > modern conveniences

**Impact:** 
- Slightly more boilerplate code (but manageable)
- Broader reach (supports iOS 16.0+)
- More resources and examples available
- Familiar to most iOS developers

**Trade-off:** Accept some Objective-C legacy patterns for compatibility

---

### Decision 2: Entity Structure with Sync Metadata

**Choice:** Store essential message fields + sync tracking fields

**Rationale:**
- Need full message data to work completely offline
- Add `isSynced`, `syncAttempts`, `lastSyncError`, `needsSync` for queue management
- Enables intelligent retry logic and error handling
- Server timestamp is source of truth for conflicts

**Impact:**
- Messages work offline without any network dependency
- Detailed sync status tracking for debugging
- Retry logic with exponential backoff possible
- Slightly larger storage footprint (~10-20% more, acceptable)

**Fields Added:**
- `isSynced: Bool` - Has message been sent to Firebase?
- `syncAttempts: Int` - How many times have we tried to sync?
- `lastSyncError: String?` - Error message if sync failed
- `needsSync: Bool` - Should we attempt to sync this message?

---

### Decision 3: Network-Aware Auto-Sync

**Choice:** Automatic sync triggered by network state changes

**Rationale:**
- Best user experience (WhatsApp model - invisible sync)
- No user intervention required
- Messages send as soon as connection available
- Aligns with offline-first philosophy
- Requires NetworkMonitor (adds 30 min, but worth it)

**Impact:**
- Users never think about "sending" queued messages
- Seamless experience across poor network conditions
- Foundation for presence and typing indicators (future PRs)
- NetworkMonitor useful for UI (connection banner)

**Sync Triggers:**
1. When network state changes from offline → online
2. When app returns to foreground (future PR)
3. Manual trigger via SyncManager (for error recovery)

---

### Decision 4: Server-Wins Conflict Resolution

**Choice:** Server timestamp always wins conflicts

**Rationale:**
- Simplest approach for MVP
- Avoids complex merge logic
- Matches Firebase's eventual consistency model
- Conflicts rare in messaging (append-only data)

**Impact:**
- Clean, predictable behavior
- No data corruption risk
- Fast implementation
- Can enhance later if needed (merge strategies)

**Conflict Handling:**
1. Local message sent offline with client timestamp
2. Server receives message, assigns server timestamp
3. Real-time listener fires with server version
4. LocalDataManager updates local copy with server data
5. Local timestamp replaced with server timestamp

---

### Decision 5: Cascade Delete for Relationships

**Choice:** Deleting conversation cascades to messages

**Rationale:**
- Messages without conversation are orphaned (no way to display)
- Automatic cleanup simplifies data management
- Matches user expectations ("delete chat" = delete all messages)
- Prevents database bloat

**Impact:**
- Clean data model
- No orphaned records
- Simple conversation deletion logic
- User can't recover messages after conversation delete (acceptable)

**Delete Rules:**
- `Conversation → Messages`: Cascade (delete messages when conversation deleted)
- `Message → Conversation`: Nullify (deleting message doesn't delete conversation)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Build Order (Why This Sequence?)

```
Phase 1: Core Data Setup (Foundation)
   ↓
Phase 2: LocalDataManager (CRUD Operations)
   ↓
Phase 3: SyncManager (Offline Queue)
   ↓
Phase 4: NetworkMonitor (Connection Detection)
   ↓
Phase 5: App Integration
   ↓
Phase 6: Testing & Verification
```

**Why Bottom-Up:**
- Can test each layer independently
- Foundation solid before building on it
- Easier to debug (isolate problems)
- Natural dependency flow

---

### Timeline Breakdown

```
Hour 1: Core Data Foundation
├─ 0-15 min:   Create .xcdatamodeld file
├─ 15-25 min:  Define entities (MessageEntity, ConversationEntity)
├─ 25-40 min:  Generate entity classes manually
└─ 40-60 min:  Create PersistenceController

Hour 2: Data Operations
├─ 0-25 min:   LocalDataManager: Message CRUD
├─ 25-40 min:  LocalDataManager: Conversation CRUD
├─ 40-60 min:  LocalDataManager: Sync operations

Hour 3: Sync & Integration
├─ 0-15 min:   NetworkMonitor implementation
├─ 15-45 min:  SyncManager with network awareness
├─ 45-60 min:  App integration + testing
```

---

### Key Principles

**1. Offline-First**
- Save to local storage first (instant)
- Sync to Firebase in background (when available)
- User never waits for network

**2. Optimistic UI**
- Message appears immediately when sent
- Status updates follow (sending → sent → delivered → read)
- Roll back only on permanent failure (rare)

**3. Automatic Everything**
- Sync triggers automatically (network changes)
- Retry on failure (exponential backoff)
- No user intervention required

**4. Fail Gracefully**
- Network unavailable? Queue locally
- Sync failed? Retry later
- Max attempts reached? Log error, don't crash

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Core Data Learning Curve 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue:** Team may not be familiar with Core Data  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium (could slow implementation)

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive code examples provided in spec
- Step-by-step checklist guides implementation
- Visual Core Data editor reduces complexity
- Fallback: Apple's documentation is excellent

**Status:** 🟢 Mitigated with detailed examples

---

### Risk 2: Sync Conflicts 🟡 HIGH

**Issue:** Local and server data may conflict  
**Likelihood:** High (especially with poor networks)  
**Impact:** High (could cause data loss or duplication)

**Mitigation:**
- Server timestamp always wins (last-write-wins)
- Client updates local data with server version
- UUID generated on device prevents ID conflicts
- Firestore's built-in conflict resolution

**Status:** 🟢 Strategy defined and straightforward

---

### Risk 3: Performance Degradation 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue:** Large message history may slow queries  
**Likelihood:** Medium (1000+ messages per conversation)  
**Impact:** High (laggy UI is unacceptable)

**Mitigation:**
- Add indexes on frequently queried fields
- Use compound indexes for sorted queries
- Implement fetch limits (pagination)
- Profile with Instruments before declaring complete

**Status:** 🟢 Mitigated with indexes and pagination

---

### Risk 4: Network Detection Reliability 🟢 LOW

**Issue:** NetworkMonitor may not detect all connection changes  
**Likelihood:** Low (NWPathMonitor is reliable)  
**Impact:** Medium (messages stuck in queue)

**Mitigation:**
- Use Apple's NWPathMonitor (official API)
- Test on physical device (more reliable than simulator)
- Add manual sync trigger (for edge cases)
- Foreground sync trigger (PR #18) as backup

**Status:** 🟢 Low risk, well-understood API

---

### Risk 5: Storage Limits 🟢 LOW

**Issue:** Device may run out of storage  
**Likelihood:** Low (messages are small)  
**Impact:** Medium (app crashes or fails to save)

**Mitigation:**
- Text messages are tiny (~150 bytes each)
- Images stored as URLs (not locally)
- Future: Message pruning (keep last 1000 per conversation)
- Future: Compress local images

**Status:** 🟢 Not a concern for MVP

---

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Manageable with careful implementation

---

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Use Visual Core Data Editor

**Why:** Much easier than code for entity definition

**How:**
1. Create `.xcdatamodeld` file in Xcode
2. Use visual interface to add entities, attributes, relationships
3. Xcode validates your model automatically
4. Export to code only for custom logic

**Result:** 10x faster than defining entities in code

---

### Tip 2: In-Memory Store for Testing

**Why:** Fast, isolated tests without persistent side effects

**How:**
```swift
let controller = PersistenceController(inMemory: true)
let context = controller.container.viewContext
// Test with this context
```

**Result:** Tests run in milliseconds, no cleanup needed

---

### Tip 3: Compound Indexes for Performance

**Why:** Dramatically speeds up sorted queries

**How:**
- Open `.xcdatamodeld`
- Select entity > Indexes tab
- Add compound index: `conversationId, sentAt`

**Result:** 10-100x faster for paginated message queries

---

### Tip 4: Profile Before Declaring Complete

**Why:** Performance problems show up at scale

**How:**
1. Insert 1000+ test messages
2. Profile with Instruments (Product > Profile > Core Data)
3. Identify slow queries
4. Add indexes or optimize fetch requests

**Result:** Confidence that app scales to real-world usage

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:

- ✅ You have 2-3 hours available (can split across sessions)
- ✅ PR #4 is complete (models exist)
- ✅ Comfortable with databases (or willing to learn Core Data)
- ✅ Understand the importance of offline-first
- ✅ Ready to build foundational infrastructure

### No-Go If:

- ❌ PR #4 not complete (need Message/Conversation models)
- ❌ Time-constrained (<2 hours available)
- ❌ Want to focus on UI first (this is backend/data layer)
- ❌ Unfamiliar with Core Data and no time to learn
- ❌ Not comfortable with database concepts

### Decision Aid:

**This PR is critical for MVP.** Without it:
- Messages disappear on app restart (fails MVP requirement #3)
- No offline message composition (fails MVP requirement #10)
- User trust eroded (data loss feels broken)
- Real-time messaging won't work properly (depends on local cache)

**Recommendation:** Build now. Everything after this depends on persistence.

**Deferral Risk:** High - Core Messaging phase (PRs #7-11) all depend on this
