#### Test 1.4: No RSVP detected (False Positive Prevention)

**Input Messages**:
```
1. "What time?"
2. "Where is it?"
3. "Thanks for organizing!"
4. "See you all soon"
5. "Good idea!"
6. "Sounds fun"
7. "Who else is going?"
8. "Can I bring a friend?"

**Expected Results**:
| Message | Detected | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| "What time?" | false | 0.0 | Question, not RSVP |
| "Where is it?" | false | 0.0 | Question |
| "Thanks for organizing!" | false | 0.0 | Gratitude |
| "See you all soon" | false or true | <0.5 | Ambiguous, acceptable either way |
| "Good idea!" | false | 0.0 | Comment |
| "Sounds fun" | false or true | <0.5 | Ambiguous |
| "Who else is going?" | false | 0.0 | Question |
| "Can I bring a friend?" | false | 0.0 | Question |
| "Is there parking?" | false | 0.0 | Question |
| "Excited!" | false or true | <0.5 | Ambiguous |

**Critical**: False positive rate must be <5%

---

### Test Category: Keyword Filter Optimization

#### Test 1.5: Keyword filter pre-screening

**Goal**: Verify 80%+ of non-RSVP messages skip GPT-4 call

**Test Method**:
```typescript
it('should filter out non-RSVP messages without calling GPT-4', () => {
  const messages = [
    "What time?",
    "Where is it?",
    "Thanks!",
    "Good idea",
    "Who's going?",
    "See you there",
    "Sounds good", // Has keyword but ambiguous
    "Yes!", // Has keyword, should continue
    "No thanks" // Has keyword, should continue
  ];
  
  const gpuCallCount = 0;
  messages.forEach(async msg => {
    const result = await detectRSVP({...data, messageText: msg}, context);
    if (passedKeywordFilter) gpuCallCount++;
  });
  
  // Expect: Only 3 of 9 messages (33%) call GPT-4
  // "Sounds good", "Yes!", "No thanks"
  expect(gpuCallCount).toBeLessThan(messages.length * 0.4);
});
```

**Success Criteria**: <40% of messages call GPT-4 (60%+ filtered out)

---

## 2. Integration Tests (End-to-End)

### Test Scenario 2.1: RSVP to Calendar Event

**Preconditions**:
- User A, B, C in group chat (3 participants)
- Calendar event exists: "Pizza party Friday 6pm"
- Calendar card displayed in chat

**Test Steps**:
```
1. User B sends: "Yes!"
2. Wait 2-3 seconds for AI detection
3. Verify RSVP detected (status=yes, confidence>0.9)
4. Verify RSVP saved to Firestore:
   /events/{eventId}/rsvps/{userB}
5. Verify RSVP section appears below calendar card
6. Verify summary shows: "1 of 3 confirmed"
7. User B appears in "Yes" list
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ RSVP detected within 3 seconds
- ✅ Firestore document created
- ✅ UI updates automatically
- ✅ Summary text correct
- ✅ Participant list correct

**Success Criteria**: All steps pass, no errors

---

### Test Scenario 2.2: Multiple RSVPs

**Preconditions**:
- Same as 2.1 (3 participants, event exists)

**Test Steps**:
```
1. User A sends: "Count me in!"
   → Summary: "1 of 3 confirmed"
   → Yes list: [User A]

2. User B sends: "Can't make it, sorry"
   → Summary: "1 of 3 confirmed, 1 declined"
   → Yes list: [User A]
   → No list: [User B]

3. User C sends: "Maybe, depends on work"
   → Summary: "1 of 3 confirmed, 1 declined, 1 tentative"
   → Yes list: [User A]
   → No list: [User B]
   → Maybe list: [User C]
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ All 3 RSVPs detected correctly
- ✅ Summary updates after each response
- ✅ Participants appear in correct sections
- ✅ Counts accurate (1 yes, 1 no, 1 maybe)

---

### Test Scenario 2.3: Change RSVP

**Preconditions**:
- User A previously RSVPd "Yes"
- RSVP section shows "1 of 3 confirmed"

**Test Steps**:
```
1. User A sends: "Actually, I can't make it"
2. Wait for AI detection
3. Verify RSVP updated in Firestore:
   /events/{eventId}/rsvps/{userA}
   status: "no" (was "yes")
4. Verify UI updates:
   → Summary: "0 of 3 confirmed, 1 declined"
   → Yes list: [] (empty)
   → No list: [User A]
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ RSVP overwritten (merge: true in Firestore)
- ✅ Summary updates correctly
- ✅ User moves from Yes to No section
- ✅ No duplicate entries

---

### Test Scenario 2.4: RSVP Without Recent Event

**Preconditions**:
- Group chat exists
- No calendar events created recently
- User sends RSVP message

**Test Steps**:
```
1. User A sends: "Yes, I'll be there!"
2. AI detects RSVP (status=yes)
3. But eventId = null (no recent events)
4. RSVP not saved to Firestore
5. Optional: Show toast "No recent event found"
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ RSVP detected (GPT-4 works)
- ✅ eventId is null (no event to link)
- ✅ No Firestore write (graceful handling)
- ✅ No crash or error

**Note**: This is acceptable behavior for MVP. Future: Manual event selection.

---

### Test Scenario 2.5: Expand/Collapse RSVP Section

**Preconditions**:
- Event with 5 RSVPs (3 yes, 1 no, 1 maybe)
- RSVP section displayed (collapsed by default)

**Test Steps**:
```
1. Tap RSVP header
   → Expands with smooth animation (0.3s spring)
   → Shows full participant list (3 sections)
   → Chevron rotates up
   
2. Tap header again
   → Collapses with smooth animation
   → Only summary visible
   → Chevron rotates down
   
3. Repeat 3 times
   → Animation smooth every time
   → No lag or jank
   → 60fps maintained
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Expand/collapse works on tap
- ✅ Animation smooth (spring, 0.3s)
- ✅ Chevron rotates correctly
- ✅ 60fps performance

---

## 3. Edge Case Tests

### Test Case 3.1: Ambiguous Responses

**Scenario**: Messages that could be RSVP or not

**Test Cases**:
| Message | Detected | Status | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| "Sounds good!" | true/false | yes/none | 0.4-0.7 | Ambiguous, acceptable either way |
| "See you there" | true/false | yes/none | 0.5-0.8 | Implies yes, but not explicit |
| "I'll try to come" | true | maybe | 0.6-0.8 | Should detect as maybe |
| "Not sure if I can" | true | maybe | 0.7-0.9 | Clear maybe |
| "Excited!" | false | none | <0.5 | Not an RSVP, just excitement |

**Success Criteria**: 
- Confidence <0.7 = show warning icon (questionmark.circle)
- User can manually correct if wrong
- No crashes on ambiguous input

---

### Test Case 3.2: Multiple Events in Conversation

**Scenario**: Two events in last 10 messages

**Setup**:
```
Message 1 (10 min ago): "Pizza party Friday 6pm"
  → Event A created

Message 2 (5 min ago): "Soccer practice Thursday 4pm"
  → Event B created

Message 3 (Now): User A says "Yes!"
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- AI receives eventIds: [B, A] (most recent first)
- GPT-4 should link to Event B (most recent)
- Confidence should be >0.8 (clear recency)

**Test**:
```typescript
it('should link RSVP to most recent event', async () => {
  const result = await detectRSVP({
    ...data,
    messageText: 'Yes!',
    recentEventIds: ['eventB', 'eventA'] // Most recent first
  }, context);
  
  expect(result.eventId).toBe('eventB');
  expect(result.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);
});
```

---

### Test Case 3.3: Sarcastic or Negative Responses

**Scenario**: Sarcasm or negative phrasing

**Test Cases**:
| Message | Should Detect | Status | Confidence | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|------------|-------|
| "Oh yeah, I'll DEFINITELY be there... NOT" | false | none | <0.5 | GPT-4 should detect sarcasm |
| "Absolutely not" | true | no | >0.9 | Clear no |
| "Yeah right" | false | none | <0.5 | Sarcastic, not RSVP |
| "As if I'd miss it" | true | yes | 0.6-0.8 | Positive, but sarcastic-sounding |

**Success Criteria**: 
- GPT-4 detects obvious sarcasm (confidence <0.5)
- Sarcastic RSVPs not saved (<0.7 threshold)

---

### Test Case 3.4: Emoji-Only Responses (MVP: Not Supported)

**Scenario**: User responds with emoji only

**Test Cases**:
| Message | Detected | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| "👍" | false | MVP: Text only |
| "❌" | false | MVP: Text only |
| "🤷" | false | MVP: Text only |
| "Yes! 👍" | true | Text "Yes!" detected, emoji ignored |

**Expected Behavior (MVP)**:
- Emoji-only messages NOT detected
- Text + emoji: Text detected, emoji ignored
- No crashes on emoji input

**Future Enhancement (PR#18.1)**: Support emoji RSVP detection

---

### Test Case 3.5: Multi-Person RSVPs

**Scenario**: "Count us both in!" (2 people)

**Expected Behavior (MVP)**:
- Detect as single RSVP for sender
- Show confidence <0.8 (ambiguous count)
- UI shows only sender in list

**Future Enhancement**: 
- Detect "us" = 2 people
- Prompt user to add second person
- Manual multi-person RSVP

---

## 4. Performance Tests

### Benchmark 4.1: Detection Latency

**Test**: Measure time from message send to RSVP displayed

**Setup**:
- WiFi connection
- Cloud Function warm (recently called)
- Test message: "Yes!"

**Measurement**:
```swift
// In ChatViewModel
let startTime = Date()
let result = try await aiService.detectRSVP(...)
let duration = Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime)
print("Detection time: \(duration)s")
```

**Target Performance**:
- **Cold start** (first call after deploy): <5 seconds (95th percentile)
- **Warm** (subsequent calls): <2 seconds (95th percentile)
- **Cached** (same message again): <100ms (instant)

**Test Results Table**:
| Scenario | Target | Measured | Status |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Cold start | <5s | ___s | ⏳ |
| Warm | <2s | ___s | ⏳ |
| Cached | <100ms | ___ms | ⏳ |

---

### Benchmark 4.2: RSVP Summary Load Time

**Test**: Measure time to fetch and display RSVP summary

**Setup**:
- Event with N participants (10, 25, 50)
- All RSVPs saved in Firestore
- Measure fetchRSVPSummary() duration

**Measurement**:
```swift
let startTime = Date()
let summary = try await aiService.fetchRSVPSummary(eventId: "test")
let duration = Date().timeIntervalSince(startTime)
print("Load time (\(summary.totalParticipants) participants): \(duration)s")
```

**Target Performance**:
- **10 participants**: <500ms
- **25 participants**: <1s
- **50 participants**: <1s
- **100+ participants**: <2s (acceptable)

**Test Results Table**:
| Participants | Target | Measured | Status |
|--------------|--------|----------|--------|
| 10 | <500ms | ___ms | ⏳ |
| 25 | <1s | ___s | ⏳ |
| 50 | <1s | ___s | ⏳ |
| 100 | <2s | ___s | ⏳ |

---

### Benchmark 4.3: Keyword Filter Efficiency

**Test**: Measure percentage of messages that skip GPT-4

**Setup**:
- 100 real group chat messages (mixed RSVP and non-RSVP)
- Track keyword filter pass/fail

**Expected Distribution**:
- 80% messages fail keyword filter (no GPT-4 call)
- 20% messages pass keyword filter (GPT-4 called)

**Measurement**:
```typescript
let totalMessages = 0;
let gpuCalls = 0;

messages.forEach(msg => {
  totalMessages++;
  if (passedKeywordFilter(msg)) {
    gpuCalls++;
  }
});

const efficiency = 1 - (gpuCalls / totalMessages);
console.log(`Keyword filter efficiency: ${efficiency * 100}%`);
// Target: >80%
```

**Success Criteria**: >75% messages filtered out (avoid GPT-4 cost)

---

### Benchmark 4.4: UI Responsiveness

**Test**: Measure animation frame rate and tap responsiveness

**Setup**:
- Event with 50 RSVPs
- RSVP section displayed
- Profile with FPS counter

**Measurements**:
1. **Expand/collapse animation**: 60fps (no dropped frames)
2. **Scroll performance**: 60fps with participant list visible
3. **Tap response time**: <100ms from tap to animation start

**Test Method**:
```
1. Open Xcode Instruments
2. Select "Core Animation" template
3. Profile app during RSVP section usage
4. Check FPS counter
   - Target: 60fps sustained
   - Acceptable: >50fps (no visible jank)
```
