# PR#14: Image Sharing - Quick Start

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Add image sharing to messaging‚Äîselect from library/camera, compress automatically, upload to Firebase Storage, display thumbnails in chat, tap for full-screen with pinch-zoom.

**Why:** Images are 55% of messages on WhatsApp. Visual communication is essential. Without images, app feels incomplete.

**Time:** 2-3 hours estimated

**Complexity:** MEDIUM-HIGH (Firebase Storage, image processing, UIKit integration)

**Status:** üìã PLANNED (documentation complete, ready to implement!)

---

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This?

**Build it if:**
- ‚úÖ Have 2-3 hours available this session
- ‚úÖ PRs #4, #5, #9, #10, #11 complete (core messaging working)
- ‚úÖ Firebase project has Storage enabled
- ‚úÖ Excited about visual communication
- ‚úÖ Want feature-complete MVP messaging

**Skip it if:**
- ‚ùå Time-constrained (<2 hours available)
- ‚ùå Core messaging not working yet (do PR #9-11 first)
- ‚ùå Firebase Storage not configured
- ‚ùå Other higher priorities
- ‚ùå Prefer to polish existing features first

**Decision Aid:** If you can send text messages reliably (PR #10 complete), you're ready for images. Images are relatively independent‚Äîthey use the same messaging infrastructure. If messaging works, images will work.

---

## Prerequisites (5 minutes)

### Required (Must Have)
- [ ] **PR #4 complete:** Message model exists (will add image fields)
- [ ] **PR #5 complete:** ChatService exists (already handles Message.toDictionary())
- [ ] **PR #9 complete:** ChatView UI exists (will add image display)
- [ ] **PR #10 complete:** Real-time messaging works (images use same flow)
- [ ] **PR #11 complete:** Message status works (images get status too)
- [ ] **Firebase Storage enabled:** In Firebase Console > Build > Storage
- [ ] **Physical device available:** For camera testing (simulator has no camera)

### Setup Commands
```bash
# 1. Verify Firebase Storage enabled
# Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/[your-project]/storage
# Should see Storage bucket created

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/pr14-image-sharing

# 3. Open Xcode project
open messAI.xcodeproj
```

### Verify Prerequisites
```swift
// In Xcode, verify these files exist:
// - Models/Message.swift (PR #4)
// - Services/ChatService.swift (PR #5)
// - Views/Chat/ChatView.swift (PR #9)
// - ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift (PR #10)

// Build project (Cmd+B) - should succeed with 0 errors
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Firebase Storage bucket not found"
**Symptoms:** Upload fails with "bucket not found" error  
**Cause:** Storage not enabled in Firebase Console  
**Solution:**
1. Visit https://console.firebase.google.com/project/[your-project]/storage
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Accept default security rules
4. Wait for bucket to provision (~30 seconds)
5. Retry upload

---

### Issue 2: "Photo library permission denied"
**Symptoms:** Image picker doesn't open, permission alert shows  
**Cause:** Info.plist missing photo library usage description  
**Solution:**
1. Open `messAI/Info.plist`
2. Add key: `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`
3. Value: `"Select photos to send in messages"`
4. Rebuild and run
5. Permission alert will show correctly

---

### Issue 3: "Image too large, upload takes forever"
**Symptoms:** Upload progress stuck at 10-20% for minutes  
**Cause:** Image not compressed before upload  
**Solution:**
1. Verify `ImageCompressor.compress()` is called BEFORE upload
2. Check compression settings: `maxSizeMB: 2.0`, `maxWidth: 1920`
3. Test with `print("Compressed size: \(data.count / 1024 / 1024) MB")`
4. Should be <2MB for any image

---

### Issue 4: "Cannot resolve StorageService"
**Symptoms:** Xcode error: "Cannot find 'StorageService' in scope"  
**Cause:** StorageService file not added to Xcode project target  
**Solution:**
1. Right-click `Services` folder in Xcode
2. "New File" > Swift File
3. Name: `StorageService.swift`
4. Ensure "messAI" target is checked
5. Add code from implementation checklist

---

### Issue 5: "Image appears stretched or squished"
**Symptoms:** Image aspect ratio incorrect in chat bubble  
**Cause:** Missing or incorrect `aspectRatio` calculation  
**Solution:**
1. Verify Message model has `imageWidth` and `imageHeight` fields
2. Check `aspectRatio` computed property:
   ```swift
   var aspectRatio: Double? {
       guard let width = imageWidth, let height = imageHeight, height > 0 else { return nil }
       return Double(width) / Double(height)
   }
   ```
3. Use in AsyncImage:
   ```swift
   .aspectRatio(message.aspectRatio ?? 1.0, contentMode: .fill)
   ```

---

### Issue 6: "Upload progress doesn't update"
**Symptoms:** Progress stays at 0%, then jumps to 100%  
**Cause:** Progress handler not called on @MainActor  
**Solution:**
1. Verify progress callback uses Task/@MainActor:
   ```swift
   progressHandler: { [weak self] progress in
       Task { @MainActor in
           self?.imageUploadProgress = progress
       }
   }
   ```
2. Ensure ChatViewModel properties are @Published:
   ```swift
   @Published var imageUploadProgress: Double = 0.0
   ```

---

### Issue 7: "Pinch-zoom not working"
**Symptoms:** Full-screen image doesn't zoom with pinch gesture  
**Cause:** Gesture not attached or state not updating  
**Solution:**
1. Verify MagnificationGesture is attached to image:
   ```swift
   .gesture(
       MagnificationGesture()
           .onChanged { value in
               scale = lastScale * value
           }
           .onEnded { _ in
               lastScale = scale
           }
   )
   ```
2. Check `@State` variables exist:
   ```swift
   @State private var scale: CGFloat = 1.0
   @State private var lastScale: CGFloat = 1.0
   ```

## Help & Support

### Stuck on Phase 1 (Image Utilities)?
**Problem:** Compression not working correctly  
**Debug:**
1. Print image size before/after:
   ```swift
   print("Original size: \(image.size.width)x\(image.size.height)")
   let compressed = ImageCompressor.compress(image)
   print("Compressed bytes: \(compressed?.count ?? 0)")
   ```
2. Expected: Compressed bytes < 2,097,152 (2MB)
3. Test with large image (4000x3000 from camera/web)
4. If >2MB, check compression loop and quality reduction

---

### Stuck on Phase 2 (Storage Service)?
**Problem:** Upload fails or doesn't complete  
**Debug:**
1. Check Firebase Storage is enabled (Console > Storage)
2. Verify storage.rules deployed: `firebase deploy --only storage`
3. Test with simple upload:
   ```swift
   let testData = "Test".data(using: .utf8)!
   let ref = Storage.storage().reference().child("test.txt")
   ref.putData(testData) { metadata, error in
       print("Upload result: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Success")")
   }
   ```
4. Check Firebase Console for uploaded file

---

### Stuck on Phase 5 (UI Display)?
**Problem:** Images don't show in chat  
**Debug:**
1. Check Message has valid URLs:
   ```swift
   print("Image URL: \(message.imageURL ?? "nil")")
   print("Thumbnail URL: \(message.thumbnailURL ?? "nil")")
   ```
2. Test URL in browser - should download image
3. Check AsyncImage phase:
   ```swift
   case .empty: print("Loading...")
   case .success: print("Loaded!")
   case .failure(let error): print("Failed: \(error)")
   ```
4. Verify MessageImageView added to MessageBubbleView

---

### Want to Skip Optional Features?
**Can Skip:**
- Camera support (just use photo library) - Saves 5 min
- Full-screen zoom (just show full image) - Saves 10 min
- Upload progress (just show spinner) - Saves 15 min

**Cannot Skip:**
- Image compression (required for performance)
- Firebase Storage (required for cloud sync)
- Thumbnail generation (required for chat performance)
- Message model updates (required for data structure)

**Impact:** Skipping camera reduces testing burden. Skipping zoom/progress reduces polish but core feature works.

---

### Running Out of Time?
**Priority Order:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Compression + Upload + Display (Phases 1-3) - 75 min
   - Without this: Images don't work at all
2. **HIGH:** ViewModel + Basic Display (Phases 4-5) - 90 min
   - Without this: Can't send or view images
3. **MEDIUM:** Input + Full-screen (Phases 5-6) - 45 min
   - Without this: Awkward UX but functional
4. **LOW:** Testing + Polish (Phase 7) - 30 min
   - Skip for MVP, test manually

**Minimum Viable:** Phases 1-5 = ~2 hours, gives working image sharing
