## What We're Building

### The Vision

A conversational AI agent that helps busy parents plan family events through natural multi-turn dialogue. This is the **crown jewel** of MessageAI's AI features—a true agent system that demonstrates advanced capabilities beyond simple extraction.

### The Experience

**Sarah's Journey**:
1. Taps purple brain icon in chat: "Plan Event"
2. Agent: "Hi! I'm your event planning assistant. What event would you like to plan?"
3. Sarah: "I want to plan Emma's birthday party"
4. Agent: "Great! What date were you thinking?"
5. Sarah: "Next Saturday at 2pm"
6. Agent: "Perfect! Who should I invite?"
7. Sarah: "Her class from school"
8. Agent: "Got it! Where will the party be?"
9. Sarah: "Our house"
10. Agent: "Wonderful! Here's what I have: Emma's Birthday Party, Oct 28, 2-5pm at your house, 12 invites. Sound good?"
11. Sarah: "Yes, create it!"
12. Agent: "✨ All done! I've created the event and sent invitations to 12 people. I'll track RSVPs for you automatically!"

**Time Saved**: 20-30 minutes of manual coordination → 2-minute conversation

### Key Features Delivered

1. **Multi-Turn Conversation** - Natural dialogue (not just Q&A)
2. **Flexible Information Gathering** - Handles info in any order
3. **State Management** - Remembers context across turns
4. **Tool Calling** - Takes actions (create event, send invites, track RSVPs)
5. **Progress Indication** - Visual progress bar shows where in flow
6. **Error Recovery** - Handles corrections, ambiguity, cancellation
7. **Multi-Device Support** - Session persists, can resume on different device
8. **Professional UI** - Purple-themed agent card with smooth animations

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Agent Framework - AI SDK by Vercel ✅

**Choice**: AI SDK by Vercel (as recommended in project spec)

**Why**:
- Project spec explicitly recommends it
- Perfect balance: powerful but not overwhelming
- TypeScript-native (matches our Cloud Functions stack)
- Excellent tool calling support (critical for agent actions)
- Active development, modern API, strong typing
- 5-6 hour implementation vs 7+ for custom

**Alternatives Considered**:
- OpenAI Swarm (too limited for multi-tool use case)
- LangChain (too heavy, steeper learning curve)
- Custom implementation (more time, reinventing wheel)

**Impact**: Faster development, cleaner code, production-ready patterns

---

### Decision 2: State Management - Firestore-Backed ✅

**Choice**: Persist agent state to Firestore (not in-memory or client-side)

**Why**:
- **Reliability**: Survives Cloud Function restarts (critical)
- **Multi-Device**: Can start on iPhone, continue on iPad
- **Resumability**: Users can pause planning, come back later
- **Debuggability**: Can inspect agent state in Firestore console
- **Cost**: Negligible (~$0.0001 per state save)
- **Performance**: <100ms overhead (acceptable)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- In-memory state (lost on restart, no multi-device)
- Client-side state (lost on app restart, security risk)

**Impact**: Production-quality reliability, better UX (resume sessions)

---

### Decision 3: Conversation Flow - Guided Flexible ✅

**Choice**: Agent guides with questions but accepts answers in any order

**Why**:
- **Natural UX**: Feels conversational, not robotic
- **Handles Variations**: User can say "Birthday party next Saturday at 2pm" → Agent extracts all three pieces
- **Still Structured**: Agent guides when needed ("What time?")
- **Manageable Complexity**: 5-6 hours to implement (vs 7+ for fully flexible)
- **GPT-4 Strength**: Excellent at flexible extraction

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Strict linear flow (too robotic, can't handle natural input)
- Fully flexible flow (too complex, 7+ hours to implement well)

**Impact**: Best of both worlds - natural conversation with clear structure

---

### Decision 4: Action Execution - Confirm Before Executing ✅

**Choice**: Agent asks "Should I proceed?" before creating event

**Why**:
- **Safety**: AI can make mistakes, user should review first
- **Trust**: Users control what happens (not autopilot)
- **Industry Standard**: ChatGPT, Claude, Siri all do this
- **Acceptable Cost**: One extra conversational turn
- **Prevents Errors**: Better safe than sorry

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Execute immediately (too risky, can't undo)
- Batch at end (feels disconnected from conversation)

**Impact**: User trust, error prevention, professional experience

- ✅ Firestore-backed state (inspect in console for debugging)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for each step
- ✅ Extensive logging at state transitions
- ✅ Manual testing with diverse inputs

**Status**: 🟡 Acceptable risk with mitigations

---

### Risk 2: GPT-4 Unpredictability 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue**: GPT-4 might generate unexpected responses or miss information

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Structured prompts with clear instructions
- ✅ Function calling for reliable extraction
- ✅ Confidence scoring (low confidence = ask for confirmation)
- ✅ User confirmation before executing actions
- ✅ Fallback to simpler extraction if needed

**Status**: 🟡 Acceptable risk (AI assisted, human confirmed)

---

### Risk 3: Cost Overruns 🟢 LOW

**Issue**: GPT-4 API costs could exceed budget

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Estimate: 5-10 turns * 300 tokens/turn = 2000 tokens (~$0.10)
- ✅ Track tokensUsed and cost per session
- ✅ Alert if session exceeds 20 turns (likely stuck)
- ✅ Rate limiting from PR#14 (100 requests/hour/user)
- ✅ Can switch to GPT-3.5-turbo if needed (5x cheaper)

**Status**: 🟢 Low risk, well within budget

---

### Risk 4: Implementation Complexity 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue**: 5-6 hour estimate might be optimistic

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Use agent framework to reduce boilerplate
- ✅ Comprehensive planning (this document!)
- ✅ Implementation checklist with realistic estimates
- ✅ Start simple (MVP flow), add flexibility later
- ✅ Can cut optional features (resume, advanced error recovery)

**Status**: 🟡 Timeline risk, manageable with scope control

---

### Risk 5: User Confusion 🟢 LOW

**Issue**: Users might not understand how to interact with agent

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Clear "Event Planning Assistant" branding
- ✅ Progress indicator shows where in flow
- ✅ Agent asks clear, specific questions
- ✅ Example prompts in UI ("Try: Plan Emma's birthday")
- ✅ Can cancel anytime

**Status**: 🟢 Low risk, good UX mitigates

## Hot Tips for Success

### Tip 1: Start with Infrastructure 🏗️

Build SessionManager and Agent core first. Get state management solid before adding conversation logic. This foundation makes everything else easier.

**Why**: If state breaks, entire agent breaks. Solid foundation = smooth development.

---

### Tip 2: Test Each Step Independently 🧪

Don't wait until end to test. After each step handler, test it:
```
User: "Birthday party"
Agent: [Should ask for date]
```

**Why**: Easier to fix bugs in isolated steps than debug full conversation.

---

### Tip 3: Use Simple Prompts Initially ✍️

Start with basic prompts, optimize later:
```typescript
const prompt = `The user said: "${userMessage}". 
Extract the date and time. Respond with confirmation.`;
```

**Why**: Complex prompts can introduce bugs. Start simple, refine based on results.

---

### Tip 4: Log Everything for Debugging 🔍

Add console.log at every state transition:
```typescript
console.log('[Agent] Step:', session.currentStep);
console.log('[Agent] Extracted info:', extractedInfo);
console.log('[Agent] Next step:', nextStep);
```

**Why**: Cloud Functions can be hard to debug. Logs are your friend.

---

### Tip 5: Handle "I Don't Know" Gracefully 🤷

Test with ambiguous input:
```
User: "I'm not sure about the date yet"
Agent: "No problem! Let's figure out the other details first. Who should I invite?"
```

**Why**: Real users are messy. Agent should handle uncertainty.
