## What We're Building

### Feature: AI-Powered Decision Summarization

**One-Sentence Description:**
"AI reads 50 group chat messages in 2 seconds and extracts decisions, action items, and key points into a scannable summary card."

**Target User:**
Sarah, working mom with 2 kids, who returns from a meeting to 50+ messages in the school parent group.

**Value Proposition:**
Saves 10-15 minutes/day by summarizing group chat backlogs. "Tell me what I missed in 30 seconds."

### What Gets Built (6 Phases)

| Phase | Component | Lines | Time |
|-------|-----------|-------|------|
| 1 | Cloud Function (decisionSummary.ts) | ~250 | 60 min |
| 2 | iOS Models (ConversationSummary, ActionItem) | ~250 | 45 min |
| 3 | AIService Extension (summarizeConversation) | ~120 | 60 min |
| 4 | ChatViewModel Integration (state management) | ~100 | 45 min |
| 5 | UI Components (DecisionSummaryCardView) | ~250 | 60 min |
| 6 | Integration Testing (end-to-end validation) | - | 30 min |
| **Total** | **Full Feature** | **~970 lines** | **3-4 hours** |

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Manual Trigger (Button) vs Automatic

**Choice:** **Manual trigger** (user taps "Summarize" button in toolbar)

**Rationale:**
- User control (user decides when summary needed)
- Cost efficiency (only generate when requested, ~$0.06 each)
- Performance (no delay when opening conversations)
- Upgrade path (can add auto-trigger in PR#20)

**Impact:**
- Users must remember to tap button (not automatic)
- But: Prevents unnecessary API calls and costs
- But: Gives user sense of control over AI features

---

### Decision 2: Separate Firestore Collection vs Embedded in Messages

**Choice:** **Separate /summaries collection** (one doc per conversation)

**Rationale:**
- Conversation-scoped (one summary per conversation, not per message)
- Efficient queries (easy to fetch latest summary without scanning messages)
- Historical tracking (can store multiple dated snapshots)
- Clean separation (summaries are conversation-level, not message-level)

**Impact:**
- One extra Firestore read per summary display
- But: Cleaner data model and easier queries
- But: Can track summary history over time

---

### Decision 3: Last 50 Messages (Fixed) vs All Unread

**Choice:** **Last 50 messages** (fixed count)

**Rationale:**
- Predictable performance (always ~2,000 tokens, ~2s processing)
- Predictable cost (always ~$0.06 per summary)
- Good coverage (50 messages = 1-2 days of active chat)
- Fits GPT-4 context limit (8k tokens allows 50 messages + summary)

**Impact:**
- May miss older context in slow-moving chats
- But: Covers 95% of use cases (active group chats)
- Future enhancement: Allow user to select scope (10/50/100/all)

---

### Decision 4: Inline Card (Top of Chat) vs Modal Overlay

**Choice:** **Inline card** (pinned at top of chat, above messages)

**Rationale:**
- Always visible (summary stays on screen while scrolling)
- Context-preserved (users can read summary while referencing messages)
- iOS native (matches Notes, Mail summary patterns)
- Dismissible (user can tap "x" to hide if not needed)

**Impact:**
- Takes up screen real estate
- But: User explicitly requested summary (expected)
- But: Can dismiss if not needed

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline (3-4 hours)

```
Hour 1: Cloud Function Implementation
├─ Create decisionSummary.ts (~250 lines)
├─ Update processAI router (+20 lines)
├─ Deploy to Firebase
└─ Test with sample conversation

Hour 2: iOS Models & AIService
├─ ConversationSummary model (~150 lines)
├─ ActionItem model (~100 lines)
├─ AIService.summarizeConversation() (~120 lines)
└─ Test caching (5-minute TTL)

Hour 3: ChatViewModel & UI
├─ Summary state management (~100 lines)
├─ DecisionSummaryCardView (~250 lines)
├─ ChatView integration (+80 lines)
└─ Test collapse/expand animations

Hour 4: Integration Testing
├─ End-to-end test (tap → generate → display → dismiss)
├─ Cache test (second request instant)
├─ Empty conversation test
└─ Firestore persistence verification
```

### Key Principle

**"Test after EACH phase"** - Don't move forward until current phase works. This prevents compounding bugs and makes debugging easier.

### Build Order

1. **Backend first** (Cloud Function) - Foundation must be solid
2. **Models next** (Data structures) - TypeScript + Swift alignment critical
3. **Service layer** (AIService) - Business logic with caching
4. **ViewModel** (ChatViewModel) - State management
5. **UI last** (DecisionSummaryCardView) - Visual polish
6. **Test thoroughly** (Integration) - Validate entire flow

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative (Must Pass)

**Performance:**
- ✅ Summary generation: <5 seconds (cold start), <1 second (cached)
- ✅ Cache hit rate: >60% (5-minute TTL)
- ✅ Accuracy: >80% relevant information extracted
- ✅ False positives: <20% (irrelevant items in summary)

**Cost:**
- ✅ Cost per summary: ~$0.06 (50 messages with GPT-4)
- ✅ Monthly cost/user: ~$3-6 (1-2 summaries/day)
- ✅ Annual cost/user: ~$36-72/year

**Quality:**
- ✅ All 30+ test scenarios pass
- ✅ No critical bugs
- ✅ UI is polished and intuitive
- ✅ Firestore persistence working

### Qualitative (Should Pass)

**User Experience:**
- Summary is concise and actionable (not verbose)
- Decisions are clearly stated (not ambiguous)
- Action items include who/when if mentioned
- UI feels native and polished (iOS-style)
- Animations are smooth (spring animation, 60fps)

**Code Quality:**
- Functions are well-documented (JSDoc, Swift comments)
- Error handling is comprehensive (all edge cases covered)
- Code is maintainable (clear structure, named constants)
- No memory leaks (proper cleanup)

---

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Low AI Accuracy 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** GPT-4 might not extract decisions/action items accurately  
**Mitigation:**
- Use GPT-4 (not 3.5) for better reasoning
- Provide clear prompt with structured JSON format
- Test with diverse conversation types
- Add confidence scoring in future PR
**Status:** Documented, will monitor during testing

---

### Risk 2: High API Costs 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Users might request summaries too frequently  
**Mitigation:**
- Manual trigger (user controls when to summarize)
- 5-minute cache (prevents duplicate calls)
- Rate limiting from PR#14 (100 req/hour)
- Show cost estimate in UI future enhancement
**Status:** Mitigated with caching + rate limiting

---

### Risk 3: Slow GPT-4 Response 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Cold start >5 seconds  
**Mitigation:**
- Set 30-second timeout (fail gracefully)
- Show progress indicator ("Analyzing 50 messages...")
- Use gpt-3.5-turbo for faster response (trade accuracy for speed)
- Cache aggressively (5-minute TTL)
**Status:** Acceptable for MVP, will optimize if needed

---

### Risk 4: Privacy Concerns 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Sending messages to OpenAI  
**Mitigation:**
- Use secure HTTPS connection (TLS 1.3)
- OpenAI does not store data for 30+ days (per policy)
- User consent: Show disclaimer ("AI will analyze messages")
- Future: Allow opt-out or on-device processing
**Status:** Acceptable for MVP, disclosed in UI

---

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test with Real Conversations
**Why:** Synthetic test data doesn't reveal edge cases. Real group chats have typos, slang, emojis, complex decisions.  
**How:** Create test group with 3+ users, send 50 realistic messages (scheduling, questions, decisions).

### Tip 2: Monitor OpenAI Costs
**Why:** Easy to exceed budget if caching breaks or rate limiting fails.  
**How:** Check platform.openai.com/usage after each test session. Look for unexpected spikes.

### Tip 3: Cache is Critical
**Why:** Without caching, costs 10x higher and UX suffers (slow every time).  
**How:** Verify console logs show "✅ AIService: Using cached summary" on second request.

### Tip 4: Test Empty Conversations
**Why:** Edge case that causes crashes if not handled.  
**How:** Create conversation with 0 messages, tap "Summarize", verify graceful error message.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR#14 (Cloud Functions) is 100% complete and deployed
- ✅ OpenAI API account active with $5+ credits
- ✅ You have 3-4 hours available for focused work
- ✅ You're excited about AI-powered features
- ✅ You want to deliver high-value user feature

### No-Go If:
- ❌ PR#14 not complete (HARD DEPENDENCY - cannot proceed)
- ❌ No OpenAI API account or credits (feature won't work)
- ❌ Less than 3 hours available (can't finish in one session)
- ❌ Not interested in AI features right now (skip to PR#17-23)
- ❌ Concerned about API costs (need to evaluate budget first)

**Decision Aid:**
- If uncertain about PR#14 status → Check `firebase functions:list` for `processAI`
- If uncertain about costs → Start with manual trigger, monitor first 10 summaries
- If tight on time → Defer to after completing PR#15 (Calendar Extraction)
- If excited about AI → **GO! This is a flagship feature!**
