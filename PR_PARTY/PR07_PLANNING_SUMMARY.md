## What We're Building

### Overview

The **Chat List View** is the main screen of the messaging app—the conversation hub where users see all their chats after logging in. This is the equivalent of WhatsApp's or iMessage's main conversation list.

### 4 Key Components

| Component | Lines | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **DateFormatter+Extensions** | ~80 | Smart timestamp formatting ("2m ago", "Yesterday") |
| **ChatListViewModel** | ~250 | State management, data loading, real-time sync |
| **ConversationRowView** | ~120 | Reusable row component for each conversation |
| **ChatListView** | ~180 | Main view with list, toolbar, empty state |

**Total New Code:** ~630 lines

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Real-Time Listener (Not Pull-to-Refresh)

**Choice:** Firestore snapshot listener for automatic updates

**Rationale:**
- Messaging apps require real-time updates (core MVP feature)
- Firestore handles connection management efficiently
- Users expect conversations to update automatically without manual refresh
- All competitive messaging apps use real-time

**Impact:** 
- Better UX: Conversations always current, no stale data
- Battery: Slightly higher usage (acceptable trade-off for messaging)
- Complexity: Requires proper listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**Alternative Rejected:** Pull-to-refresh only
- Would save battery but create poor messaging UX
- Users would miss messages unless they manually refresh
- Not competitive with WhatsApp, iMessage, etc.

---

### Decision 2: Local-First Data Loading

**Choice:** Load from Core Data first, sync Firestore in background

**Rationale:**
- Instant app launch (<1 second) is critical for UX
- Offline functionality is core MVP requirement
- WhatsApp model: show cached data immediately, sync silently
- Real-time listener ensures freshness within 2 seconds

**Impact:**
- Fast: App launches instantly with local data
- Offline: Works without internet connection
- Brief staleness: Data may be outdated for 1-2 seconds (acceptable)

**Alternative Rejected:** Cloud-first (Firestore only)
- Would break offline mode (MVP requirement)
- Slow app launch (2-3 second delay)
- Poor UX waiting for network

---

### Decision 3: LazyVStack for Performance

**Choice:** LazyVStack instead of standard List or ForEach

**Rationale:**
- Virtualized rendering (only visible rows rendered)
- Scales to power users (100+ conversations)
- 60fps scrolling performance
- Minimal complexity increase (SwiftUI best practice)

**Impact:**
- Performance: Smooth scrolling with any number of conversations
- Memory: Efficient (only visible rows in memory)
- Complexity: Slightly more setup than basic List

**Alternative Rejected:** Standard List
- Would lag with 100+ conversations
- All rows rendered at once (memory intensive)

---

### Decision 4: Defer User Names/Photos to PR #8

**Choice:** Show user IDs and placeholders for now

**Rationale:**
- PR #7 focuses on conversation list structure
- PR #8 (Contact Selection) will add UserService for names/photos
- Allows PR #7 to be completed without additional dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns

**Impact:**
- PR #7 completes faster (2-3h instead of 4-5h)
- Placeholder UI acceptable for internal testing
- Clean integration point for PR #8

**Alternative Rejected:** Add UserService in PR #7
- Would extend PR #7 timeline significantly
- Mixes concerns (list UI + user management)
- Better to keep focused scope

---

### Decision 5: Placeholder ChatView Navigation

**Choice:** Navigate to placeholder screen (real ChatView in PR #9)

**Rationale:**
- Allows testing navigation structure now
- PR #9 will replace placeholder with real chat interface
- Unblocks testing and development workflow

**Impact:**
- Can test navigation pattern immediately
- Clean integration when ChatView is built
- No rework needed

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline
```
Phase 1: Date Formatter (30 min)
├─ Create extension file
├─ Implement relativeDateString()
└─ Test with various dates

Phase 2: ChatListViewModel (1 hour)
├─ Properties & initialization
├─ Load from local storage
├─ Start Firestore listener
└─ Helper methods

Phase 3: ConversationRowView (45 min)
├─ Profile picture with AsyncImage
├─ Name + last message layout
├─ Timestamp + unread badge
└─ SwiftUI preview

Phase 4: ChatListView (45 min)
├─ NavigationStack setup
├─ Conversation list with LazyVStack
├─ Empty state
└─ Lifecycle management

Phase 5: Integration & Testing (30 min)
├─ Update ContentView
├─ Manual testing
└─ Performance verification
```

### Key Principle

**"Local-first, real-time second"**

1. Load local data instantly (no waiting)
2. Start background sync automatically
3. Update UI silently when sync completes
4. Never block user interaction

Result: Fast, responsive, always-current interface

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- [ ] Initial load: <1 second (from Core Data)
- [ ] Firestore sync: <2 seconds
- [ ] Real-time update latency: <2 seconds
- [ ] Scroll performance: 60fps with 100+ conversations
- [ ] Memory usage: <30MB for 100 conversations

### Qualitative
- [ ] Conversations load instantly on app launch
- [ ] List stays up-to-date automatically
- [ ] Smooth scrolling with no lag
- [ ] Works offline without errors
- [ ] No memory leaks (verified with Instruments)

---

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Real-Time Listener Memory Leaks 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Firestore listeners not properly detached cause memory leaks  
**Mitigation:** 
- Implement `stopListening()` in ViewModel
- Call in `.onDisappear` lifecycle hook
- Use `Task` cancellation for cleanup
- Test with Xcode Instruments (Leaks tool)

**Status:** Mitigated (requires verification during testing)

---

### Risk 2: Slow Initial Load 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Core Data fetch could be slow with many conversations  
**Mitigation:**
- LazyVStack for virtualized rendering
- Limit Core Data fetch to 100 recent conversations
- Index on `lastMessageAt` field in Core Data model

**Status:** Low risk (proper architecture in place)

---

### Risk 3: Stale Data Briefly Displayed 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Brief moment where local data is outdated before Firestore syncs  
**Mitigation:**
- Real-time listener updates within 2 seconds
- Pull-to-refresh available for manual sync
- Acceptable UX trade-off for instant display

**Status:** Acceptable (intentional design decision)

---

### Risk 4: Navigation to ChatView Not Working Yet 🟢 NONE
**Issue:** ChatView doesn't exist yet (PR #9)  
**Mitigation:**
- Use placeholder view for navigation
- Test navigation structure works
- Replace placeholder in PR #9

**Status:** Expected behavior (not a risk)

---

## Dependencies & Integration Points

### Requires (Already Complete)
- ✅ PR #4: Conversation model
- ✅ PR #5: ChatService with `fetchConversations()`
- ✅ PR #6: LocalDataManager with Core Data
- ✅ Firebase Auth: Current user ID available

### Blocks (Waiting on This PR)
- 🚧 PR #8: Contact Selection (needs ChatListView for navigation)
- 🚧 PR #9: ChatView (needs ChatListView to navigate from)

### Future Integration Points
- **PR #8:** Will add `UserService` to fetch names/photos (replace placeholders)
- **PR #9:** Will replace navigation placeholder with real ChatView
- **PR #11:** Will implement unread count calculation

**Unit Tests: ChatListViewModel (6 tests)**
- Load from local, sort by recent, start listener, stop listener, get name, get photo

**Integration Tests (12 tests)**
- Full load flow, empty state, navigation, pull-to-refresh, real-time update, offline mode, edge cases, performance

**Total:** 24 test cases

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial load: Target <1s
- Firestore sync: Target <2s
- Scroll: Target 60fps
- Real-time: Target <2s latency

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Listener Cleanup Early
**Why:** Memory leaks from Firestore listeners are hard to debug later. Test cleanup immediately after implementing listener.

**How:**
1. Open Xcode Instruments (Cmd+I)
2. Choose "Leaks" template
3. Run app, open ChatListView
4. Background app
5. Verify memory doesn't continually increase

---

### Tip 2: Use Debug Prints Liberally
**Why:** Real-time behavior is hard to see in UI. Logging helps verify data flow.

**Where:**
```swift
// In loadConversationsFromLocal
print("✅ Loaded \(conversations.count) from local")

// In startRealtimeListener
print("🔥 Firestore update: \(conversations.count) conversations")

// In stopListening
print("🛑 Stopped listener")
```

---

### Tip 3: Test Offline Mode Early
**Why:** Offline is a core MVP requirement. Don't discover issues at the end.

**How:**
1. Run app with conversations
2. Enable airplane mode
3. Force quit app
4. Relaunch
5. Verify conversations load from Core Data

---

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ PR #6 complete (Core Data persistence available)
- ✅ PR #5 complete (ChatService available)
- ✅ PR #4 complete (Conversation model exists)
- ✅ You have 2-3 hours available
- ✅ Comfortable with MVVM + async/await

### No-Go If:
- ❌ PR #6 not complete (critical dependency)
- ❌ Time-constrained (<2 hours)
- ❌ Need to debug previous PRs first
- ❌ Not familiar with SwiftUI or Combine

### Decision Aid

**If uncertain:** Start with Phase 1 (Date Formatter). This is low-risk and takes only 30 minutes. If it goes smoothly, continue. If not, defer PR #7 until you're more comfortable.

**Minimum viable path:** Can complete bare-bones version in 90 minutes if needed (see Quick Start Guide).
