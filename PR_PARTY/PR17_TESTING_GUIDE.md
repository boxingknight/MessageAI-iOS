# PR#17: Push Notifications - Testing Guide

**Comprehensive test strategy for Firebase Cloud Messaging integration**

---

## Overview

This testing guide covers **28 comprehensive test scenarios** across 5 categories:
- Unit Tests (5 tests)
- Integration Tests (8 tests)
- Edge Cases (6 tests)
- Performance Tests (4 tests)
- Acceptance Criteria (5 tests)

**Testing Philosophy:** Push notifications are a critical user-facing feature. Every test scenario should pass before declaring this PR complete.

**Time Required:** ~1 hour for full test suite (30 min device testing + 30 min verification)

## Test Environment Setup

### Required Equipment

**2 Physical iOS Devices:**
- Device A: Your primary testing device (logged in as User A)
- Device B: Secondary device or simulator (logged in as User B)

**Why Physical Devices:**
- iOS Simulator cannot receive push notifications
- Need to test APNs integration end-to-end
- Need to test lock screen notifications
- Need to test app closed/backgrounded states

**Minimum Configuration:**
- iOS 16.0+
- Connected to WiFi or cellular
- Logged into different user accounts
- Push notification permission granted

---

### Test Data Setup

#### Create Test Users (5 minutes)

Display Name: Alice Test
Password: testpass123
```

**User B (Secondary Tester):**
```
Email: tester2@messageai.test
Display Name: Bob Test
Password: testpass123
```

**User C (Group Testing):**
```
Email: tester3@messageai.test
Display Name: Charlie Test
Password: testpass123
```

#### Create Test Conversations

**1. One-on-One Conversation:**
- Participants: Alice, Bob
- Messages: 2-3 test messages

**2. Group Conversation:**
- Participants: Alice, Bob, Charlie
- Group Name: "Test Group"

- User B sends message
- Expected: No notification (already viewing)

**2. User just read the message:**
- User B sends message
- User A opens conversation and reads
- User B sends another message within 5 seconds
- Expected: Notification received (user may have left conversation)

**3. Message already read via other device:**
- User A reads message on Device A (iPhone)
- Same message synced to Device B (iPad)
- Expected: Badge clears on both devices

**Pass Criteria:**
- No notifications when actively viewing conversation
- No notification spam or duplicates
- Read state syncs across devices

### Test 27: CRITICAL - Permission UX is Clear

**Objective:** Verify users understand why permission is requested

**Setup:**
- Fresh install
- New user (never seen permission prompt before)

**Steps:**
1. Launch app for first time
2. Complete sign up/sign in
3. Permission dialog appears
4. Read dialog text

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Dialog appears at appropriate time (after sign in, not immediately)
- ‚úÖ Custom description visible: "MessageAI needs notifications to alert you when you receive new messages..."
- ‚úÖ Description is clear and specific (not generic)
- ‚úÖ User understands value before deciding

**User Testing:**
- Show app to 5 people who haven't seen it
- Ask: "Would you grant notification permission?"
- Target: 70%+ say yes (understand value)

**Pass Criteria:**
- Permission request timing appropriate
- Description clear and valuable
- 70%+ grant permission (user testing)

---

### Test 28: CRITICAL - Works on Poor Network (3G)

**Objective:** Verify graceful degradation on slow network

**Setup:**
- Device A: Enable Network Link Conditioner (3G)
  - Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Network Link Conditioner ‚Üí 3G
- Device B: Normal network

**Steps:**
1. Device A: 3G network enabled, app backgrounded
2. Device B: Send message
3. Wait and observe Device A

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Notification still delivered (may take 5-10 seconds)
- ‚úÖ No timeout errors
- ‚úÖ No crash
- ‚úÖ Message appears when app opens
- ‚úÖ Badge updates eventually

**Acceptable Degradation:**
- Latency may be 5-10 seconds (vs 2-3 seconds on WiFi)
- Multiple retries may occur
- Eventually consistent (all messages delivered)

**Pass Criteria:**
- Notifications delivered despite slow network
- No data loss
- Graceful handling of delays

## Troubleshooting Failed Tests

### If Test #6 Fails (No Notification Received)

**Check in order:**

1. **APNs Configuration (Firebase Console)**
   - Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
   - APNs Auth Key uploaded? ‚úÖ
   - Key ID and Team ID correct?

2. **FCM Token (Firestore)**
   - /users/{userId}/fcmToken exists?
   - Token is recent (not stale)?

3. **Cloud Function (Firebase Console)**
   - Functions ‚Üí Logs
   - Function executed?
   - Any errors in logs?

4. **Device Permission (iOS Settings)**
   - Settings ‚Üí MessageAI ‚Üí Notifications
   - Allow Notifications = ON?

5. **Network (Device)**
   - Device connected to internet?
   - Firebase reachable?

---

### If Test #7 Fails (Deep Link Doesn't Work)

**Check in order:**

1. **Console Logs**
   - "üëÜ Notification tapped" appears?
   - "üîó Deep link received" appears?
   - ConversationId extracted correctly?

2. **Navigation Code**
   - ChatListView listening for "OpenConversation"?
   - NavigationCenter post triggered?

3. **URL Scheme**
   - Info.plist has CFBundleURLSchemes?
   - Scheme is "messageai"?

4. **Test Manually**
   ```swift
   // In Xcode, test deep linking directly:
   let url = URL(string: "messageai://conversation/[test-conversation-id]")!
   NotificationService.shared.handleDeepLink(url)
   ```

---

### If Test #13 Fails (Badge Count Wrong)

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Check Query**
   ```swift
   // Add debug logs to ChatService.getUnreadConversationCount()
   print("Total conversations: \(snapshot.documents.count)")
   print("Unread count: \(unreadCount)")
   ```

2. **Verify Logic**
   - Are you counting conversations (not messages)?
   - Are you filtering by `senderId != currentUserId`?
   - Are you checking `readBy` array?

3. **Manual Verification**
   - Count unread conversations manually in Firestore
   - Compare to badge count
   - Should match exactly

## Test Data Cleanup

After testing, clean up test data:

```bash
# Delete test messages
Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí messages
Filter by createdAt > [test start time]
Select all ‚Üí Delete

# Delete test conversations
Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí conversations
Filter by test user IDs
Select all ‚Üí Delete

# Keep test users for future testing
Do NOT delete test user accounts
```
