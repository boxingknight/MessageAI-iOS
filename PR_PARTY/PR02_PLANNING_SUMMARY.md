## What We're Building

### Overview

**Core Goal**: Implement the authentication logic layer - User model, Firebase authentication services, and state management. This PR focuses on **business logic only** - no UI yet (that comes in PR #3).

**What Gets Built**:
1. User model with Firestore conversion
2. Base FirebaseService for common utilities
3. AuthService for authentication operations
4. AuthViewModel for reactive state management
5. Temporary test UI to verify functionality

**What Gets Tested**:
- Sign up new users
- Sign in existing users
- Sign out users
- Auth state persistence
- Error handling (duplicate email, invalid credentials, weak password)
- Firebase/Firestore synchronization

---

### Files to Create

| File | Purpose | Lines | Time |
|------|---------|-------|------|
| `Models/User.swift` | User data model with Firestore conversion | ~120 | 30 min |
| `Services/FirebaseService.swift` | Base Firestore utilities | ~60 | 20 min |
| `Services/AuthService.swift` | Firebase Auth operations | ~180 | 60 min |
| `ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift` | Auth state management | ~160 | 60 min |
| **Total** | | **~520** | **2.8h** |

**Files to Modify**:
- `messAI/messAIApp.swift` - Add AuthViewModel as @StateObject
- `messAI/ContentView.swift` - Add temporary test buttons (will remove in PR #3)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: User Model Structure - Struct vs Class

**Choice**: Struct (Value Type)

**Rationale**:
- SwiftUI works best with value types
- Immutability by default (thread-safe)
- Codable conformance simpler
- No need for reference semantics

**Impact**: User objects are copied when modified, but this is minimal overhead for small structs.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Class with @Published properties → Too complex, unnecessary for this use case

---

### Decision 2: Firestore Document Creation Strategy

**Choice**: Immediate creation on signup (same transaction)

**Rationale**:
- User profile needed for chat participants
- Simpler app logic (profile always exists)
- Industry standard (WhatsApp, Signal)
- Can handle cleanup if Firestore fails

**Impact**: Need cleanup code to delete Auth user if Firestore fails.

**Implementation**:
```swift
do {
    let authResult = try await Auth.auth().createUser(...)
    try await createUserDocument(userId: authResult.user.uid, ...)
} catch {
    // Cleanup: Delete Auth user if Firestore fails
    try? await authResult.user.delete()
    throw error
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Deferred creation (after first login) → Would require null checks everywhere
- Separate creation endpoint → Adds complexity, failure modes

---

### Decision 3: Auth State Management - Singleton vs Dependency Injection

**Choice**: Dependency Injection via SwiftUI Environment

**Rationale**:
- Testability crucial for auth logic
- SwiftUI's `@EnvironmentObject` makes it easy
- Can mock for testing/previews
- Loosely coupled architecture
- Industry best practice

**Impact**: Slightly more setup code, but huge testability gains.

**Implementation**:
```swift
// In messAIApp.swift
@StateObject private var authViewModel = AuthViewModel()

var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
        ContentView()
            .environmentObject(authViewModel)
    }
}

// In any view
@EnvironmentObject var authViewModel: AuthViewModel
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Singleton pattern (`AuthViewModel.shared`) → Hard to test, global state issues
- Pass through init → Too much boilerplate

---

### Decision 4: Password Requirements

**Choice**: Lenient for MVP (6+ characters)

**Rationale**:
- MVP priority is functionality, not hardening
- Firebase has rate limiting (prevents brute force)
- Easier for testing during development
- Can tighten validation in PR #19 (Error Handling)

**Impact**: Less secure, but acceptable for development. Document to tighten before production.

**Trade-offs**:
- Gain: Faster development, easier testing
- Lose: Security (acceptable for MVP)

**Future**:
- PR #19 will add stricter validation:
  - 8+ characters
  - Uppercase + lowercase
  - Number required
  - Special character required

---

### Decision 5: Error Handling Strategy

**Choice**: Custom AuthError enum with LocalizedError

**Rationale**:
- User-friendly error messages
- Clear error types for UI
- Easy to localize later
- Wraps Firebase errors

**Implementation**:
```swift
enum AuthError: LocalizedError {
    case userNotFound
    case invalidCredentials
    case emailAlreadyInUse
    case weakPassword
    case networkError
    case unknown(Error)
    
    var errorDescription: String? {
        // User-friendly messages
    }
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pass through Firebase errors directly → Too technical for users
- String-based errors → Not type-safe

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline Overview

**Total Time**: 2-3 hours

```
Hour 1:
├─ 00:00-00:30: Phase 1 - User Model
├─ 00:30-00:50: Phase 2 - FirebaseService
└─ 00:50-01:00: Break

Hour 2:
├─ 01:00-02:00: Phase 3 - AuthService (signup, signin, signout)
└─ 02:00-02:10: Break

Hour 3:
├─ 02:10-03:10: Phase 4 - AuthViewModel
└─ 03:10-03:40: Phase 5 - Testing

Buffer: +30 min for debugging = 3.5 hours max
```

---

### Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: User Model (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Create User struct with Firestore conversion

**Tasks**:
1. Create `Models/User.swift`
2. Add properties (id, email, displayName, etc.)
3. Conform to Codable, Identifiable, Equatable
4. Add main initializer
5. Add Firestore dictionary initializer
6. Add `toDictionary()` method for Firestore writes
7. Test by creating User instance

**Key Code**:
```swift
struct User: Codable, Identifiable, Equatable {
    let id: String              // Firebase Auth UID
    let email: String
    var displayName: String
    var photoURL: String?       // Optional
    var fcmToken: String?       // Optional
    var isOnline: Bool
    var lastSeen: Date
    let createdAt: Date
}
```

**Checkpoint**: User model compiles, can create instances

---

#### Phase 2: FirebaseService (20 minutes)

**Goal**: Create base service with Firestore helpers

**Tasks**:
1. Create `Services/FirebaseService.swift`
2. Add Firestore instance
3. Add collection references (users, conversations)
4. Add helper methods (generateId, timestamps)
5. Build and verify

**Key Code**:
```swift
class FirebaseService {
    let db = Firestore.firestore()
    
    var usersCollection: CollectionReference {
        db.collection("users")
    }
    
    var conversationsCollection: CollectionReference {
        db.collection("conversations")
    }
}
```

**Checkpoint**: FirebaseService compiles, can access collections

---

#### Phase 3: AuthService (60 minutes)

**Goal**: Implement all authentication operations

**Tasks**:
1. Create `Services/AuthService.swift`
2. Add class structure and properties
3. Implement signUp (with Firestore document creation)
4. Implement signIn (with Firestore fetch)
5. Implement signOut (with online status update)
6. Implement resetPassword
7. Add helper methods (createUserDocument, fetchUserDocument, updateOnlineStatus)
8. Define AuthError enum
9. Build and verify

**Key Code**:
```swift
class AuthService {
    func signUp(email: String, password: String, displayName: String) async throws -> User
    func signIn(email: String, password: String) async throws -> User
    func signOut() async throws
    func resetPassword(email: String) async throws
}
```

**Checkpoint**: All auth methods implemented, builds successfully

---

#### Phase 4: AuthViewModel (60 minutes)

**Goal**: Create reactive state management for UI

**Tasks**:

2. Add @Published properties
3. Set up auth state listener
4. Implement signUp method (calls AuthService)
5. Implement signIn method
6. Implement signOut method
7. Implement resetPassword method
8. Add validation methods
9. Add deinit to cleanup listener
10. Build and verify

**Key Code**:
```swift
@MainActor
class AuthViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentUser: User?
    @Published var isAuthenticated: Bool = false
    @Published var errorMessage: String?
    @Published var isLoading: Bool = false
    
    func signUp(email: String, password: String, displayName: String) async
    func signIn(email: String, password: String) async
    func signOut() async
}
```

**Checkpoint**: AuthViewModel compiles, state management works

---

#### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Verify end-to-end functionality

**Tasks**:
1. Add AuthViewModel to messAIApp.swift
2. Add test buttons to ContentView
3. Test signup flow
4. Test signin flow
5. Test signout flow
6. Test auth persistence (restart app)
7. Test error cases
8. Verify Firebase Console data
9. Clean up test users

**Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Sign up new user → Appears in Firebase Auth + Firestore
- ✅ Sign out → isOnline: false in Firestore
- ✅ Sign in → isOnline: true in Firestore
- ✅ Restart app → Still authenticated
- ✅ Duplicate email → Error message
- ✅ Invalid password → Error message

**Checkpoint**: All tests pass, ready for PR #3 (UI)

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Firestore Document Creation Fails After Auth Success 🟢 MITIGATED

**Issue**: User created in Firebase Auth but no profile in Firestore  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH (orphaned auth user)

**Mitigation**:
```swift
do {
    let authResult = try await auth.createUser(...)
    try await createUserDocument(...)
} catch {
    // Cleanup: Delete auth user
    try? await authResult.user.delete()
    throw error
}
```

**Status**: ✅ Handled in AuthService implementation

---

### Risk 2: Auth State Listener Memory Leak 🟢 MITIGATED

**Issue**: Listener not removed, causes memory issues  
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: MEDIUM

**Mitigation**:
```swift
deinit {
    if let handle = authStateHandle {
        Auth.auth().removeStateDidChangeListener(handle)
    }
}
```

**Status**: ✅ Implemented in AuthViewModel

---

### Risk 3: Race Condition on State Updates 🟢 MITIGATED

**Issue**: UI updates not on main thread  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM (UI inconsistency)

**Mitigation**:
- Use `@MainActor` on AuthViewModel
- All state updates guaranteed on main thread

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

---

### Risk 4: Weak Password Validation 🟡 ACCEPTABLE FOR MVP

**Issue**: 6-character minimum is weak  
**Likelihood**: HIGH  
**Impact**: LOW for MVP, HIGH for production

**Mitigation**:
- Document in README
- Plan to tighten in PR #19
- Firebase has rate limiting (prevents brute force)

**Status**: ⚠️ Deferred to PR #19

---

### Risk 5: Test User Clutter 🟢 MANAGEABLE

**Issue**: Multiple test users in Firebase  
**Likelihood**: HIGH  
**Impact**: LOW (cleanup annoyance)

**Mitigation**:
- Use consistent email prefix (`test@example.com`)
- Manual cleanup from Firebase Console
- Document cleanup process

**Status**: ✅ Documented in testing guide

---

- [ ] Document has all required fields:
  - [ ] id, email, displayName
  - [ ] isOnline: true
  - [ ] lastSeen (timestamp)
  - [ ] createdAt (timestamp)

**After Sign Out**:
- [ ] Firestore document updated:
  - [ ] isOnline: false
  - [ ] lastSeen updated

**After Sign In**:
- [ ] Firestore document updated:
  - [ ] isOnline: true
  - [ ] lastSeen updated

---

## Hot Tips for Implementation

### Tip 1: Use Debug Logs Liberally

**Why**: Async operations are hard to debug without logs

**Implementation**:
```swift
func signUp(...) async throws -> User {
    print("🔥 Starting signup for: \(email)")
    let authResult = try await auth.createUser(...)
    print("✅ Firebase Auth user created: \(authResult.user.uid)")
    try await createUserDocument(...)
    print("✅ Firestore document created")
    return user
}
```

**Remove before merging** but keep during development!

---

### Tip 2: Test Early, Test Often

**Why**: Catch errors early when they're easy to fix

**Strategy**:
- Build after each file (`⌘ + B`)
- Run app after each phase
- Add print statements to verify state
- Check Firebase Console frequently

---

### Tip 3: Use Firebase Console as Source of Truth

**Why**: Your app might show incorrect state, but Firebase doesn't lie

**How**:
1. Keep Firebase Console open in browser
2. Refresh after each auth operation
3. Verify Auth and Firestore match
4. Compare app state to Firebase state

---

### Tip 4: Don't Optimize Prematurely

**Why**: Get it working first, then make it fast

**Strategy**:
- Focus on correctness first
- Measure performance after it works
- Only optimize bottlenecks

---

### Tip 5: Commit After Each Phase

**Why**: Easy rollback if something breaks

**Commit Messages**:
- `feat(models): create User model with Firestore conversion`
- `feat(services): create FirebaseService base class`
- `feat(services): implement AuthService with signup, signin, signout`
- `feat(viewmodels): implement AuthViewModel with state management`
- `test(auth): add temporary test UI for verification`
