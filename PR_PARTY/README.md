## Philosophy

> "Plan twice, code once."

Every hour spent planning saves 3-5 hours of debugging and refactoring. This PR_PARTY enforces a documentation-first approach that has proven to deliver better code, faster implementation, and fewer bugs.

## Current PRs

### PR #1: Project Setup & Firebase Configuration
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Branch**: `feature/project-setup` (merged to main)  
**Timeline**: 1.5 hours actual (1-2 hours estimated)  
**Started**: October 20, 2025  
**Completed**: October 20, 2025

**Documents**:
- Main Spec: `PR01_PROJECT_SETUP.md` (~8,000 words)
- Implementation Checklist: `PR01_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` (~5,000 words)
- Quick Start: `PR01_README.md` (~3,000 words)
- Planning Summary: `PR01_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md` (~4,000 words)
- Testing Guide: `PR01_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (~2,000 words)

**Summary**: Initialize Xcode project with Firebase integration. Set up project structure, add Firebase SDK via SPM, configure Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging), and create base folder structure. Deliverable: App launches with Firebase connected.

**Key Decisions**:
- Minimum iOS target: 16.0 (for broader compatibility)
- Bundle identifier: `com.isaacjaramillo.messAI`
- Firebase project name: "MessageAI"
- Dependency management: Swift Package Manager
- Project structure: MVVM with clear separation of concerns

### PR #2: Authentication - Models & Services
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Branch**: `feature/auth-services` (ready to merge)  
**Timeline**: 2.5 hours actual (2-3 hours estimated)  
**Started**: October 20, 2025  
**Completed**: October 20, 2025

**Documents**:
- Main Spec: `PR02_AUTH_SERVICES.md` (~8,000 words)
- Implementation Checklist: `PR02_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` (~7,000 words)
- Quick Start: `PR02_README.md` (~3,500 words)
- Planning Summary: `PR02_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md` (~4,500 words)
- Testing Guide: `PR02_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (~2,500 words)

**Summary**: Implement authentication logic layer with User model, FirebaseService base class, AuthService for Firebase Auth operations, and AuthViewModel for reactive state management. Users can sign up, sign in, sign out programmatically with full Firebase/Firestore integration.

**Key Decisions**:
- User model as struct (value type for SwiftUI compatibility)
- Immediate Firestore document creation on signup (with cleanup on failure)
- Dependency injection via SwiftUI Environment (not singleton)
- Lenient password validation for MVP (6+ chars, will tighten in PR #19)
- Firebase error mapping to user-friendly AuthError messages

**Files Created**:
- `Models/User.swift` (~120 lines)
- `Services/FirebaseService.swift` (~60 lines)
- `Services/AuthService.swift` (~220 lines with error mapping)
- `ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift` (~174 lines)
- **Total**: ~574 lines of code

**Tests Passed**:
- ✅ Sign up new user (creates Firebase Auth + Firestore document)
- ✅ Sign out (updates isOnline: false in Firestore)
- ✅ Sign in (updates isOnline: true in Firestore)
- ✅ Auth persistence (stays logged in on app restart)
- ✅ Error handling (duplicate email shows correct message)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

### PR #3: Authentication UI Views
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Branch**: `feature/auth-ui` (ready to merge)  
**Timeline**: 2 hours actual (1.5-2 hours estimated)  
**Started**: October 20, 2025  
**Completed**: October 20, 2025

**Documents**:
- Main Spec: `PR03_AUTH_UI.md` (~6,500 words)
- Implementation Checklist: `PR03_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` (~5,500 words)
- Quick Start: `PR03_README.md` (~3,000 words)
- Planning Summary: `PR03_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md` (~4,500 words)
- Testing Guide: `PR03_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (~2,500 words)

**Summary**: Built beautiful authentication UI with SwiftUI. Created WelcomeView (entry screen), LoginView (email/password), and SignUpView (full form). Implemented navigation, real-time validation, keyboard handling, and error displays. Replaced test UI with production-ready auth screens.

**Key Decisions**:
- NavigationStack with enum-based routing (modern iOS 16+ pattern)
- Hybrid validation (real-time + on-submit, helpful not nagging)
- Full screen welcome (conditional based on auth state)
- Hybrid keyboard handling (automatic + manual dismiss)
- Password show/hide toggle (modern UX standard)
- iOS 16 compatible onChange syntax (single parameter)

**Files Created**:
- `Views/Auth/AuthenticationView.swift` (~32 lines)
- `Views/Auth/WelcomeView.swift` (~65 lines)
- `Views/Auth/LoginView.swift` (~182 lines)
- `Views/Auth/SignUpView.swift` (~240 lines)
- **Total**: ~519 lines of SwiftUI code

**Tests Passed**:
- ✅ Navigation flow (welcome → login/signup)
- ✅ Form validation with real-time feedback (green checkmarks)
- ✅ Keyboard handling (Done button, tap-to-dismiss)
- ✅ Password show/hide toggles on both forms
- ✅ Actual signup/signin integration works perfectly
- ✅ Error message display (styled with red background)
- ✅ Dark mode support (automatic)
- ✅ Loading states with spinner during auth
- ✅ iOS 16.0+ compatibility (fixed MainActor and onChange issues)

### PR #4: Core Models & Data Structure
**Status:** 📋 PLANNED (documentation complete)  
**Branch**: `feature/core-models` (will create)  
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours estimated  
**Started**: Not started  
**Completed**: N/A

**Documents**:
- Main Spec: `PR04_CORE_MODELS.md` (~8,000 words)
- Implementation Checklist: `PR04_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` (~4,500 words)
- Quick Start: `PR04_README.md` (~3,500 words)
- Planning Summary: `PR04_PLANNING_SUMMARY.md` (~2,000 words)
- Testing Guide: `PR04_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (~4,000 words)

**Summary**: Create the fundamental data models that power the entire messaging system: Message, Conversation, MessageStatus, and TypingStatus. These models define how we structure, store, and sync chat data between SwiftUI, SwiftData, and Firebase Firestore. Foundation for all messaging features.

**Key Decisions**:
- Struct (value type) for SwiftUI compatibility and thread safety
- UUID on device for optimistic UI and offline capability
- Swift Date with Firestore Timestamp conversion for type safety
- MessageStatus as enum with String raw value for type safety
- Balanced optional field strategy (optional only when truly optional)

**Files to Create**:
- `Models/MessageStatus.swift` (~40 lines) - Enum with 5 cases and display properties
- `Models/Message.swift` (~200 lines) - Core message model with Firestore conversion
- `Models/Conversation.swift` (~250 lines) - Chat model with 1-on-1 and group support
- `Models/TypingStatus.swift` (~60 lines) - Real-time typing indicators
- **Total**: ~550 lines of model code

**What Will Be Tested**:
- ✅ Can create instances of all models
- ✅ Firestore conversion round-trip (to dict and back, lossless)
- ✅ Computed properties return expected values
- ✅ Optional fields handled correctly (nil preserved)
- ✅ Equatable and Hashable work (Set/Dict usage)
- ✅ Edge cases handled gracefully
- ✅ Works with SwiftUI (Identifiable, @Published)
