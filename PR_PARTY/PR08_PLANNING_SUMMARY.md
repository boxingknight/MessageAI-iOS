## What We're Building

### 1 Core Feature: Contact Selection for New Chats

**User Journey:**
```
1. User taps "+" button in ChatListView
2. Contact picker sheet appears
3. User sees all registered users (except self)
4. User can search/filter contacts
5. User taps a contact
6. System checks for existing conversation
   → If exists: reopen existing conversation
   → If new: create new conversation
7. Sheet dismisses
8. (PR #9 will navigate to chat view)
```

**Components to Build:**

| Component | Type | Lines | Purpose |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| ChatService extensions | Service | +40 | Fetch users, find conversations |
| ContactsViewModel | ViewModel | 200 | State + search + conversation logic |
| ContactRowView | View | 80 | Contact row with picture + status |
| ContactsListView | View | 180 | Main picker with search + states |
| ChatListView integration | View | +30 | Button + sheet presentation |

**Total Code:** ~530 lines (5 new files, 2 modified)

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: User Discovery - Fetch All from Firestore

**Choice:** Query `/users` collection and load all users

**Rationale:**
- MVP scale (<100 users) fits easily in memory
- Simplest implementation (no pagination needed)
- Firebase free tier supports 50k reads/day (plenty)
- Can optimize later if user base grows

**Impact:** 
- Fast implementation (saves 1-2 hours vs pagination)
- Works perfectly for MVP testing and demo
- Known limitation: won't scale past ~1000 users (acceptable)

**Alternative Considered:** Phone contact sync (too complex, not MVP requirement)

---

### Decision 2: Conversation Creation - Check Existing First

**Choice:** Query for existing conversation before creating new one

**Rationale:**
- Prevents duplicate conversations (data integrity)
- Reopens existing chats (expected behavior)
- Common messaging app pattern
- Small latency (~200-500ms) is acceptable

**Impact:**
- Clean data model (no duplicates)
- Better UX (conversation history preserved)
- Slightly slower than always-create (acceptable trade-off)

**Alternative Considered:** Create immediately (rejected - causes duplicates)

---

### Decision 3: Search Implementation - Client-Side Filtering

**Choice:** Filter users in ViewModel after loading all

**Rationale:**
- MVP scale (<100 users) allows in-memory filtering
- Instant search results (no network delay)
- Firestore lacks good text search (would need Algolia)
- Simple computed property, easy to implement

**Impact:**
- Fast, responsive search (<100ms)
- Works offline (bonus feature)
- All users loaded (acceptable memory usage)

**Alternative Considered:** Server-side search (too complex for MVP)

---

### Decision 4: Navigation - Sheet Presentation

**Choice:** Modal sheet over ChatListView (not NavigationLink)

**Rationale:**
- Modal sheets signal "create new" actions (iOS convention)
- Matches iOS Contacts and Messages app patterns
- Dismissible with swipe-down gesture
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Impact:**
- iOS-native feel
- Clear UX (modal context)
- Easy to dismiss (swipe down)

**Alternative Considered:** NavigationStack push (less clear "new chat" action)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### 5-Phase Approach (Sequential)

```
Phase 1: ChatService Extensions (30-45 min)
   ↓
Phase 2: ContactsViewModel (45-60 min)
   ↓
Phase 3: ContactRowView (30 min) ← Can parallelize
   ↓
Phase 4: ContactsListView (45-60 min)
   ↓
Phase 5: ChatListView Integration (30 min)
```

**Critical Path:** Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 4 → Phase 5  
**Parallelizable:** Phase 3 (ContactRowView can be built anytime)

**Key Principle:** Build and test each phase before moving to next. Each phase has a checkpoint to verify it works before proceeding.

---

### Phase Breakdown

**Phase 1: Service Layer (Foundation)**
- Add `findExistingConversation()` to ChatService
- Add `fetchAllUsers()` to ChatService
- Both methods use existing Firestore setup
- ~40 lines of code
- Checkpoint: Methods compile and return correct types

**Phase 2: ViewModel (Business Logic)**
- Create ContactsViewModel with full state management
- Implement search filter (computed property)
- Add conversation creation with check-then-create pattern
- ~200 lines of code
- Checkpoint: ViewModel compiles, filteredUsers works

**Phase 3: Row Component (UI Building Block)**
- Create ContactRowView for individual contacts
- Profile picture with AsyncImage
- Fallback to initials placeholder
- Online status indicator
- ~80 lines of code
- Checkpoint: Row displays correctly in preview

**Phase 4: Main View (Full Interface)**
- Create ContactsListView with all states
- Loading state (spinner + message)
- Empty state (when no users)
- Contact list (scrollable with search)
- Error handling (alert)
- ~180 lines of code
- Checkpoint: Full picker works in preview

**Phase 5: Integration (Connect the Dots)**
- Add "+" button to ChatListView toolbar
- Add sheet presentation
- Handle contact selection
- Create/find conversation
- ~30 lines added to existing files
- Checkpoint: End-to-end flow works (tap + → select → conversation created)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

**1. Unit Tests (8 tests)**
- ContactsViewModel filtering
- Conversation creation logic
- User exclusion logic
- Search query handling

**2. Integration Tests (5 tests)**
- Complete contact selection flow
- Search functionality end-to-end
- Existing conversation handling
- Cross-device conversation creation

**3. Edge Cases (5 tests)**
- Empty state (no users)
- Network errors (offline mode)
- Current user exclusion
- Large user lists (100+)
- Duplicate tap prevention

**4. Performance Tests (3 tests)**
- Load time (<2 seconds)
- Search performance (<100ms)
- Memory usage (<50MB)

**Total: 26 test cases** documented with expected results

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Firestore Query Performance 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Slow with 100+ users  
**Mitigation:** Add `.limit(100)` for MVP, document pagination for future  
**Status:** 🟢 Mitigated (MVP scale acceptable)

### Risk 2: Duplicate Conversations 🔴 HIGH
**Issue:** Race condition if user taps twice  
**Mitigation:** Check-then-create pattern + loading state  
**Status:** 🟢 Mitigated (atomic operation)

### Risk 3: Search Performance 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Slow with 500+ users  
**Mitigation:** Client-side OK for MVP, computed property efficient  
**Status:** 🟢 Mitigated (MVP scale acceptable)

### Risk 4: Empty Contact List 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Confusing to users  
**Mitigation:** Clear empty state with invite suggestion  
**Status:** 🟢 Mitigated (good messaging)

**Overall Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW - All major risks mitigated

## Hot Tips for Implementation

### Tip 1: Start with Service Layer
**Why:** Foundation for everything else. If ChatService methods don't work, nothing will work. Get this solid first.

### Tip 2: Test Search Early
**Why:** Search is a computed property that must trigger SwiftUI updates. Test that typing in search bar actually filters the list. If this breaks, debug before continuing.

### Tip 3: Use Print Statements Liberally
**Why:** Contact selection involves async operations. Add prints to track flow:
```swift
print("🔍 Checking for existing conversation...")
print("✅ Found existing: \(id)")
print("➕ Creating new conversation...")
```

### Tip 4: Test Duplicate Prevention
**Why:** Easy to accidentally create duplicates. Test by tapping same user twice and checking Firebase Console for conversation count.

### Tip 5: Verify Current User Excluded
**Why:** Common bug - forgetting to filter out current user. Test by searching for your own name/email.

---

## Open Questions (Now Resolved)

### ~~Question 1: Cache user list locally?~~
**Decision:** No caching for MVP. Always fetch fresh from Firestore.  
**Rationale:** Simpler, always current data. Add caching later if performance issues.

### ~~Question 2: Show offline users?~~
**Decision:** Yes, show all users with online indicator.  
**Rationale:** Users expect to message anyone anytime. Online status helps but doesn't hide.

### ~~Question 3: Implement "Recently Contacted"?~~
**Decision:** No, alphabetical sorting only for MVP.  
**Rationale:** Simpler implementation. Add smart sorting in future PR.

**All Questions Resolved** ✅
