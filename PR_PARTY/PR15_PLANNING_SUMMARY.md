## What We're Building

### Feature: AI-Powered Calendar Extraction

**One Sentence:** Automatically detect dates, times, and events in messages using GPT-4, display as calendar cards, and allow one-tap confirmation to add to iOS Calendar.

**User Story:**
```
As a busy parent,
I want dates and events automatically extracted from group chats,
So I can quickly add them to my calendar without manual copying.
```

**Example Flow:**
1. User receives message: "Soccer practice Thursday at 4pm"
2. User long-presses message ‚Üí "Extract Calendar Events"
3. AI processes (2-3 seconds) ‚Üí Calendar card appears
4. Card shows: "Soccer practice" | "Thursday, Oct 24 at 4:00 PM"
5. User taps "Add to Calendar" ‚Üí Event added to iOS Calendar
6. Success! Event is now in Calendar app

### Components to Build

| Component | Type | Lines | Time |
|-----------|------|-------|------|
| calendarExtraction.ts | Cloud Function | ~250 | 1h |
| CalendarEvent.swift | iOS Model | ~120 | 20min |
| AIService extension | iOS Service | ~80 | 20min |
| CalendarCardView.swift | SwiftUI View | ~200 | 40min |
| ChatViewModel extension | ViewModel | ~60 | 25min |
| ChatView updates | View Integration | ~40 | 20min |
| Info.plist update | Configuration | ~2 | 10min |
| **Total** | **7 files** | **~750** | **3-4h** |

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Processing Model - Hybrid Smart Approach

**Choice:** Manual trigger for MVP, automatic processing later (PR#20)

**Rationale:**
- **Cost control:** $0.02 per extraction √ó manual only = ~$3-6/month/user (manageable)
- **User control:** Privacy-conscious, user decides what gets processed
- **Proves value:** Users see it work before we auto-process everything
- **Upgrade path:** Add automatic in PR#20 (Event Planning Agent)

**Impact:** 
- ‚úÖ Low cost for MVP
- ‚úÖ User trust built through control
- ‚ùå Requires user action (extra tap)
- üìù Will add auto-processing for specific groups in PR#20

### Decision 2: Data Storage - Embedded in Message

**Choice:** Store calendar events in `message.aiMetadata.calendarEvents` (not separate collection)

**Rationale:**
- **Single read:** Messages already fetched for display (zero extra cost)
- **Co-located data:** Calendar events are metadata of messages
- **Simpler sync:** No separate collection to keep in sync
- **MVP-appropriate:** Can migrate to separate collection later if needed

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler implementation (~100 fewer lines of code)
- ‚úÖ Faster display (already have data)
- ‚úÖ Zero extra Firestore reads
- ‚ùå Can't query "all events next week" without scanning messages
- üìù If querying becomes important, add PR#21: Calendar Events Collection

### Decision 3: UI Pattern - In-Chat Calendar Cards

**Choice:** Display calendar cards directly below messages (not separate calendar view)

**Rationale:**
- **Context preservation:** Events stay in conversation context
- **Zero navigation:** See and act immediately
- **Visual prominence:** Impossible to miss
- **Proven UX:** WhatsApp/Telegram use this pattern for polls/media

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ High visibility (users can't miss events)
- ‚úÖ Zero friction (no navigation required)
- ‚úÖ Context-aware (see event in conversation flow)
- ‚ùå Takes vertical space in chat
- üìù Can add separate calendar view later (PR#21)

### Decision 4: Confirmation Required (Not Auto-Add)

**Choice:** User must tap "Add to Calendar" button to confirm (not automatic)

**Rationale:**
- **AI accuracy:** 90-95% accurate = 5-10% false positives unacceptable
- **User trust:** Confirmation builds confidence in AI
- **User control:** Prevents calendar pollution
- **One tap:** Acceptable friction for important events

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ User trust maintained
- ‚úÖ Zero calendar pollution from AI errors
- ‚úÖ User feels in control
- ‚ùå Extra tap required
- üìù Track confirmation rate to measure accuracy

## Success Metrics

### User Experience

**Primary Metric:** Confirmation Rate
- **Target:** >70% of extracted events get added to calendar
- **Measure:** Track button taps vs extractions
- **Success:** Users trust the AI enough to add events

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Discovery: >80% of users try "Extract Events" within first week
- Adoption: >50% of users use feature regularly (5+ times/week)
- Time Saved: 5-10 minutes per day (no manual calendar entry)
- False Positive Rate: <10% (user dismisses without adding)

### Technical Performance

**Extraction Accuracy:**
- Explicit dates ("Thursday 4pm"): >90% accurate
- Relative dates ("tomorrow", "next week"): >70% accurate
- All-day events ("Friday"): >80% accurate
- Location extraction: >60% when mentioned

**Processing Time:**
- Cold start: <5 seconds (first request to Cloud Function)
- Warm request: <2 seconds (subsequent requests)
- End-to-end: <3 seconds (user tap ‚Üí card appears)

**Cost per Extraction:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 API: ~$0.02 per extraction
- Daily usage: 5-10 extractions per active user
- Monthly cost: ~$3-6 per active user (manageable)

**Quality:**
- Zero critical bugs in extraction or iOS Calendar integration
- Calendar permission handling graceful (clear error if denied)
- Past events shown but not addable (visual indication)
- Confidence thresholds tuned (reject <0.5, warn 0.5-0.8, accept >0.8)

---

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Low Extraction Accuracy üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** GPT-4 is 90-95% accurate, 5-10% errors expected  
**Mitigation:**
- Show confidence score (visual indicator for <0.8)
- Require user confirmation (never auto-add)
- Collect user feedback ("Was this correct?")
- Fine-tune prompts based on error patterns
**Status:** üü¢ Mitigated (confirmation flow prevents issues)

### Risk 2: High API Costs üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** GPT-4 costs ~$0.02 per extraction = $6/month/user at 10/day  
**Mitigation:**
- Start with manual trigger only (user-initiated)
- Implement rate limiting (100 requests/hour/user from PR#14)
- Cache results (same message not processed twice)
- Monitor usage and adjust if needed
**Status:** üü° Monitor (MVP approach minimizes cost)

### Risk 3: Calendar Permission Denied üü¢ LOW
**Issue:** Users might deny calendar permission  
**Mitigation:**
- Clear permission prompt ("Add events to calendar")
- Graceful error handling (show message, link to Settings)
- Fall back to display-only (show events, copy to clipboard)
- Don't require permission upfront (request on first "Add")
**Status:** üü¢ Handled (standard iOS pattern)

### Risk 4: Complex Date/Time Parsing üü° MEDIUM
**Issue:** "next Thursday" depends on current date, time zones tricky  
**Mitigation:**
- Pass current date to GPT-4 prompt
- Use ISO 8601 format (clear, unambiguous)
- Show calculated date in UI (user can verify)
- Add "Edit" button to fix errors (future enhancement)
**Status:** üü° Monitor (will improve with feedback)

**Overall Risk Level:** üü¢ LOW (all risks have mitigation strategies)

## Dependencies

### Blocks
**None** - This is the first AI feature (no other PRs depend on it yet)

### Blocked By
**PR#14 (Cloud Functions Setup)** - MUST BE COMPLETE FIRST
- Requires: `processAI` router with auth middleware
- Requires: OpenAI integration in Cloud Functions
- Requires: `AIService.swift` base class in iOS
- Requires: `AIMetadata` models
- Requires: Cloud Functions deployed to Firebase

### Related
**PR#18 (RSVP Tracking)** - Will reuse calendar extraction
- RSVP tracking needs to know which messages contain events
- Will extend CalendarEvent with RSVP data
- Builds on PR#15 infrastructure

**PR#20 (Event Planning Agent)** - Will add automatic extraction
- Automatic processing for known calendar sources (school groups)
- Multi-turn conversation to clarify ambiguous events
- Extends PR#15 with automation

## Go / No-Go Decision

### ‚úÖ Go If:
- PR#14 (Cloud Functions) is 100% complete and deployed
- You have 3-4 uninterrupted hours available
- OpenAI API key is ready and configured
- You're excited to build the first visible AI feature
- Firebase Blaze plan is active (for Cloud Functions)

### ‚ùå No-Go If:
- PR#14 is not complete (HARD BLOCKER - cannot proceed)
- Time-constrained (<3 hours available)
- OpenAI API costs are a major concern
- Other priorities are more urgent
- Not ready to add AI features yet

### üü° Maybe / Defer If:
- Want to build other AI features first (PR#16-19 don't depend on this)
- Testing infrastructure not ready yet
- Still working on MVP core features (this is post-MVP)
- Want to wait for more user feedback before adding AI

### Decision Aid

**This is the FIRST AI feature users will see.** It sets expectations for all subsequent AI features. Build it well and users will trust the AI. Rush it or ship bugs and you damage credibility for future AI features.

**Recommendation:** 
- ‚úÖ **GO** if PR#14 is solid and you have time to do it right
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **DEFER** if rushed or PR#14 incomplete - build other features first
- üìù **DOCUMENT** your decision and reasoning

## Hot Tips from Planning

### Tip 1: Start with Explicit Dates
**Why:** "Thursday at 4pm" is much easier for GPT-4 than "sometime next week"

Test with explicit dates first:
- ‚úÖ "Soccer practice Thursday at 4pm"
- ‚úÖ "Meeting tomorrow at 2pm"
- ‚úÖ "School half day Friday"

Then test relative dates:
- "Practice next Tuesday"
- "Dinner this weekend"
- "Meeting sometime next week"

### Tip 2: Context is King
**Why:** Ambiguous messages need conversation context

Enable `includeContext: true` for better accuracy:
- Message 1: "Let's meet to discuss"
- Message 2: "How about Thursday?"
- Message 3: "4pm works" ‚Üê Extract from this with context

GPT-4 will use previous messages to infer "meeting Thursday at 4pm"

### Tip 3: Confidence Thresholds Matter
**Why:** Balance between showing everything vs hiding useful extractions

Current thresholds:
- **>0.9:** High confidence (green checkmark) - explicit dates
- **0.7-0.9:** Medium confidence (orange warning) - relative dates
- **<0.7:** Low confidence (red warning) - ambiguous, proceed with caution

Tune these based on real-world accuracy!

### Tip 4: Manual Extraction First
**Why:** Prove value before incurring automatic processing costs

MVP approach:
- User long-presses message
- Taps "Extract Calendar Events"
- AI processes on demand
- Cost: ~$0.10-0.20/day/user

Auto-processing later (PR#20):
- Process all messages from school groups automatically
- Cost: ~$0.40/day/user (2x more but worth it)

### Tip 5: Test with Real Messages
**Why:** Synthetic test messages don't reveal edge cases

Ask friends/family to send you real messages:
- School pickup changes
- Practice schedule updates
- Family event planning
- Work meeting invitations

You'll discover patterns GPT-4 handles well or poorly!

## Appendix: Technical Highlights

### GPT-4 Prompt Engineering

**System Prompt Strategy:**
- Role definition: "Calendar extraction assistant for busy parents"
- Context awareness: Pass current date/time for relative date calculation
- Format specification: JSON schema for structured output
- Confidence scoring: AI self-reports accuracy (0.0-1.0)
- Rules and constraints: 15 specific rules for extraction logic

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "title": "Soccer practice",
      "date": "2025-10-24",
      "time": "16:00",
      "isAllDay": false,
      "location": "West Field",
      "notes": "Bring water bottle",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ]
}
```

### EventKit Integration

**Permissions:**
- `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` in Info.plist
- Request access on first "Add to Calendar" tap (not upfront)
- Graceful error handling if denied

**Event Creation:**
```swift
let eventStore = EKEventStore()
let granted = try await eventStore.requestAccess(to: .event)
guard granted else { throw CalendarError.accessDenied }

let ekEvent = event.toEKEvent(eventStore: eventStore)
try eventStore.save(ekEvent, span: .thisEvent)
```

**Key Features:**
- Convert CalendarEvent ‚Üí EKEvent automatically
- Default duration: 1 hour (timed), all day (no time)
- Uses default calendar (respects user's primary calendar)
- One-tap confirmation flow
