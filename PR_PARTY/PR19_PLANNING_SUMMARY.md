## What We're Building

### AI-Powered Deadline Detection & Tracking

**The Feature**: Automatically extract deadlines from any message and display them in a visual timeline with countdown indicators.

**User Experience**:
```
User receives message: "Permission slip due Wednesday by 3pm"
     ↓
AI detects deadline automatically (no user action)
     ↓
Deadline card appears in chat below message
     ↓
Deadline also added to global Deadlines tab
     ↓
User sees countdown: "3 days remaining"
     ↓
Status updates automatically: upcoming → today → overdue
```

**Value Proposition**: "Never miss a deadline buried in group chat. See all upcoming deadlines at a glance."

**Impact**: Saves 10-15 minutes/day + prevents missed deadlines (real-world consequences: late fees, missed opportunities)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Hybrid Detection (Keyword → GPT-4)

**Choice**: Hybrid approach with keyword pre-filter then GPT-4 confirmation

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Keyword filter screens 70-80% of messages in <100ms
- **Cost**: Only call GPT-4 for messages with deadline keywords (~$0.003 vs ~$0.01 pure GPT-4)
- **Accuracy**: GPT-4 handles complex dates, keyword catches obvious ones
- **Scalability**: 100+ messages/day without budget concerns

**Impact**: 70% cost savings while maintaining >85% accuracy

**Trade-off**: Slightly more complex logic (2 stages) vs simpler pure AI approach

---

### Decision 2: Separate Firestore Collection

**Choice**: Dedicated `/deadlines` collection (not embedded in messages)

**Rationale**:
- **Querying**: Need to query all deadlines across conversations, sort by date
- **Performance**: Fetch upcoming deadlines without loading all messages
- **Real-time**: Can listen to `/deadlines` collection for updates
- **Scalability**: Doesn't pollute message documents, can have deadline-specific metadata

**Impact**: Fast queries, global deadline view, real-time updates across all conversations

**Trade-off**: Extra Firestore reads (1 per deadline fetch) vs simpler embedded approach

---

### Decision 3: Both In-Chat + Global View

**Choice**: Dual UI - deadline cards in chat + global deadline tab

**Rationale**:
- **In-chat cards**: Keep deadline in conversation context, easy to reference
- **Global tab**: See all deadlines across conversations at once
- **User flexibility**: Different users prefer different views (context vs overview)
- **Complementary**: In-chat for context, global for planning

**Impact**: Maximum flexibility, serves multiple use cases, power user feature

**Trade-off**: More UI complexity (2 views to maintain) vs simpler single-view approach

---

### Decision 4: Smart Automatic Detection

**Choice**: Automatic hybrid detection (no manual trigger button)

**Rationale**:
- **User Experience**: Zero friction, feels magical, no manual action
- **Cost Control**: Keyword filter screens 70-80% of messages for free
- **Accuracy**: GPT-4 only processes messages likely to have deadlines
- **Scale**: Can handle 100+ messages/day without excessive API costs

**Impact**: Production-ready UX that "just works" automatically

**Trade-off**: Slightly higher costs than manual trigger vs perfect user experience

## Architecture Highlights

### Cloud Function Flow
```
Message received
     ↓
Keyword pre-filter (<100ms, free)
     ├─ No keywords → Skip
     └─ Has keywords → Continue
           ↓
GPT-4 function calling (~2s, $0.003)
     ├─ Extract: title, dueDate, priority, confidence
     └─ Calculate: status, urgency
           ↓
Return structured deadline
     ↓
iOS saves to Firestore /deadlines collection
```

### iOS Data Flow
```
ChatViewModel receives message
     ↓
detectMessageDeadline() triggered automatically
     ↓
Calls AIService.extractDeadline()
     ↓
Deadline returned from Cloud Function
     ↓
Save to Firestore via DeadlineService
     ↓
Real-time listener updates:
     ├─ ChatViewModel.extractedDeadlines (in-chat cards)
     └─ DeadlineViewModel.deadlines (global tab)
```

### UI Architecture
```
In-Chat Display:
ChatView
  └─ For each message with deadline:
       └─ DeadlineCardView
            ├─ Header (icon, title, priority)
            ├─ Due date & countdown
            ├─ Description (optional)
            └─ Actions (complete, remind, dismiss)

Global Tab:
DeadlineListView
  ├─ Filter tabs (Upcoming/Today/Overdue/Completed)
  ├─ For each deadline:
  │    └─ DeadlineRowView
  │         ├─ Status indicator (colored dot)
  │         ├─ Title & due date
  │         └─ Countdown text
  └─ Empty state (when no deadlines)
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Extraction Accuracy 🟡 MEDIUM

**Issue**: GPT-4 might misinterpret dates or miss deadlines  
**Impact**: Users miss important deadlines

**Mitigation**:
- Keyword pre-filter ensures we only process likely candidates
- GPT-4 confidence scoring (only show if >0.7 confidence)
- User can manually add/edit deadlines (future feature)
- Learn from false negatives (log and improve prompts)

**Status**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Needs careful prompt engineering

---

### Risk 2: High API Costs 🟢 LOW

**Issue**: Too many GPT-4 calls could exceed budget  
**Impact**: Unexpected costs

**Mitigation**:
- Hybrid approach filters 70-80% of messages before GPT-4
- Rate limiting from PR#14 (100 req/hour/user)
- Caching to prevent duplicate extractions
- Monitor costs in Firebase console

**Status**: 🟢 LOW - Well mitigated with hybrid approach

---

### Risk 3: Timezone Confusion 🟢 LOW

**Issue**: Deadline times might be wrong due to timezone  
**Impact**: User misses deadline

**Mitigation**:
- Use device's local timezone for interpretation
- GPT-4 returns ISO 8601 with timezone
- Display timezone in UI for clarity
- Test with various timezone scenarios

**Status**: 🟢 LOW - Standard date handling patterns

---

### Risk 4: Firestore Query Performance 🟢 LOW

**Issue**: Querying all user deadlines might be slow  
**Impact**: Poor UX (slow loading)

**Mitigation**:
- Composite Firestore indexes on (extractedBy, status, dueDate)
- Limit query to active statuses (upcoming/today/overdue)
- Client-side caching for repeat views
- Pagination for users with 100+ deadlines

**Status**: 🟢 LOW - Standard Firestore optimization

---

### Risk 5: Duplicate Detection 🟢 LOW

**Issue**: Same deadline detected multiple times  
**Impact**: UI clutter, wasted API calls

**Mitigation**:
- Track processed message IDs in ChatViewModel
- Skip detection if message already processed
- Firestore document ID prevents server-side duplicates

**Status**: 🟢 LOW - Simple to prevent

---

### Risk 6: Notification Spam 🟢 LOW

**Issue**: Too many deadline notifications annoy users  
**Impact**: User disables notifications

**Mitigation**:
- Don't implement notifications in this PR (defer to PR#22)
- Deadline badge on tab (non-intrusive)
- User controls notification preferences
- Smart notification timing (24h before, 1h before)

**Status**: 🟢 LOW - Deferred to PR#22

## Hot Tips 🔥

### Tip 1: Keyword Filter is Critical
**Why**: Saves 70-80% of API costs by screening messages before GPT-4

**How**: Be strict - require BOTH deadline keywords AND date patterns

### Tip 2: Test with Real Deadline Messages
**Why**: Synthetic test data doesn't reveal all edge cases

**How**: Copy actual messages from school parent groups, work chats

### Tip 3: Status Auto-Update Logic
**Why**: Deadlines move from upcoming → today → overdue automatically

**How**: Computed properties + real-time listeners handle this automatically

### Tip 4: Firestore Indexes Are Essential
**Why**: Composite queries on (user, status, date) won't work without them

**How**: Run query once, follow Firebase Console link to create index

### Tip 5: Don't Over-Complicate Actions
**Why**: Users just need "Mark Complete" for MVP

**How**: Defer "Add Reminder" to PR#22, defer "Edit" to future PR
