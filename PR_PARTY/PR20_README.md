## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This?

**Build it if:**
- ‚úÖ PRs #14, #15, #18 are 100% complete (REQUIRED)
- ‚úÖ You have 5-6 uninterrupted hours available
- ‚úÖ You want to maximize Gauntlet submission score (+10 bonus!)
- ‚úÖ You want an impressive portfolio piece (conversational AI agents)
- ‚úÖ You're comfortable with multi-step systems
- ‚úÖ You want the most advanced feature in MessageAI

**Skip/defer it if:**
- ‚ùå PRs #14, #15, or #18 incomplete (HARD BLOCKERS)
- ‚ùå Time constrained (<5 hours available)
- ‚ùå Prefer to focus on polish/testing instead
- ‚ùå Want to keep submission simpler (5 required features already complete)

### Decision Aid

**This is OPTIONAL** - You already have 5 required AI features. This adds +10 bonus points but isn't required for submission.

**Build this if**: You want to go above and beyond, demonstrate advanced AI capabilities, and maximize your score.

**Skip this if**: You'd rather focus on polish, testing, and ensuring the 5 required features are perfect.

**Recommendation**: **BUILD IT** - It's the most impressive feature, great for demo video, and differentiates your submission. 5-6 hours for +10 points = great ROI.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Agent not responding

**Symptoms**: Cloud Function called but no response, timeout error

**Cause**: OpenAI API key not configured or invalid

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check configuration
cd functions
firebase functions:config:get openai.key

# If empty, set it
firebase functions:config:set openai.key="sk-..."

# Redeploy
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Prevention**: Verify API key in prerequisites step

---

### Issue 2: Session state not persisting

**Symptoms**: Agent forgets context, repeats questions

**Cause**: SessionManager not saving to Firestore, or Firestore rules blocking writes

**Solution**:
1. Check Firestore console ‚Üí Collections ‚Üí agentSessions
2. Verify documents being created
3. Check Firestore rules allow writes:
```javascript
// firebase/firestore.rules
match /agentSessions/{sessionId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
                       request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```
4. Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

**Prevention**: Test SessionManager independently before building on it

---

### Issue 3: Steps not progressing

**Symptoms**: Agent stuck in same step, not moving forward

**Cause**: Step handler not returning correct `nextStep` value

**Solution**:
1. Add logging in agent.ts:
```typescript
console.log('[Agent] Current step:', session.currentStep);
console.log('[Agent] Next step:', result.nextStep);
```
2. Check step handler returns valid PlanningStep
3. Verify step handler logic matches conversation flow

**Prevention**: Use TypeScript enums for PlanningStep (type safety)

---

### Issue 4: High token usage / costs

**Symptoms**: tokensUsed > 2000 per session, cost > $0.10

**Cause**: Prompts too long, or too many GPT-4 calls

**Solution**:
1. Reduce conversation context (limit to 10-20 messages)
2. Make prompts more concise
3. Use GPT-3.5-turbo for simple steps:
```typescript
model: session.currentStep === 'greeting' ? 'gpt-3.5-turbo' : 'gpt-4'
```
4. Cache common responses

**Prevention**: Track tokensUsed per step, optimize high-usage steps

---

### Issue 5: Agent confused by user input

**Symptoms**: Agent asks wrong questions, misunderstands user

**Cause**: Insufficient context in prompts, or poor prompt engineering

**Solution**:
1. Improve system prompt:
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are an event planning assistant for busy parents.
Your job is to gather information about an event they want to plan.

Current step: ${session.currentStep}
What you know so far: ${JSON.stringify(session.gatheredInfo)}

Ask ONE clear question to move the conversation forward.
Be conversational and helpful. Keep responses under 50 words.`;
```

2. Provide more examples in prompt:
```typescript
Example conversation:
User: "I want to plan a birthday party"
Assistant: "Great! What's the date for the birthday party?"
User: "Next Saturday"
Assistant: "Perfect! What time should it start?"
```

**Prevention**: Test with diverse inputs, refine prompts based on errors

---

### Issue 6: Actions not executing

**Symptoms**: Agent says "Creating event" but nothing happens

**Cause**: Tool functions not implemented, or errors not caught

**Solution**:
1. Check execution.ts logs for errors
2. Verify createEvent tool works:
```typescript
// Test independently
const result = await createEvent(testEventInfo, testConversationId);
console.log('Event created:', result);
```
3. Add try-catch in execution step:
```typescript
try {
  const result = await createEvent(...);
  action.status = 'completed';
  action.result = result;
} catch (error) {
  action.status = 'failed';
  action.error = error.message;
  console.error('[Execution] Error:', error);
}
```

**Prevention**: Test each tool function independently before integration

- `messAI/Views/Chat/AgentCardView.swift` - Agent UI

### Key Functions

**Start agent session**:
```swift
viewModel.startEventPlanning()
```

**Send message to agent**:
```swift
viewModel.sendToAgent("Next Saturday at 2pm")
```

**Cancel agent session**:
```swift
viewModel.cancelEventPlanning()
```

### Key Concepts

**Step-based flow**: Agent progresses through 9 steps sequentially
- greeting ‚Üí event_type ‚Üí date_time ‚Üí participants ‚Üí location ‚Üí details ‚Üí confirmation ‚Üí creating ‚Üí completed

**Firestore-backed state**: All session state persists to Firestore
- Survives app restarts
- Enables multi-device support
- Provides debugging visibility

**RAG pipeline**: Agent retrieves conversation context from Firestore
- Last 20 messages for context
- Formatted for GPT-4 prompt
- Helps agent understand conversation flow

**Tool calling**: Agent executes actions when confirmed
- createEvent: Creates event in Firestore
- sendInvites: Sends invitations to participants
- trackRSVPs: Initializes RSVP tracking (reuses PR#18)

### Useful Commands

**Deploy agent function**:
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions:eventPlanningAgent
```

**Check function logs**:
```bash
firebase functions:log --only eventPlanningAgent --limit 50
```

**Test agent locally** (Firebase emulator):
```bash
firebase emulators:start --only functions
```

**Check Firestore sessions**:
```
Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí agentSessions collection
```
