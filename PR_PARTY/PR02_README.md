# PR #2: Authentication Services - Quick Start Guide

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Building the authentication logic layer - User model, AuthService, and AuthViewModel (no UI yet)

**Why:** Core authentication is the foundation for every feature in the app

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Status:** 📋 PLANNED

---

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This Now?

**Green Lights (Build it!):**
- ✅ You completed PR #1 (Firebase configured)
- ✅ You have 2-3 uninterrupted hours available
- ✅ You want to learn Firebase Auth + Firestore integration
- ✅ You're comfortable with Swift async/await
- ✅ You understand MVVM architecture basics

**Red Lights (Skip/defer it!):**
- ❌ PR #1 not complete (Firebase not set up)
- ❌ Time-constrained (<2 hours available)
- ❌ Prefer to build UI first (but logic-first is better!)
- ❌ Unfamiliar with Swift async/await (but good learning opportunity!)

**Decision Aid:** This PR is **critical path** - everything else depends on it. Can't skip!

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot find 'Timestamp' in scope"

**Symptoms:**
- Build error on `Timestamp` type
- User.swift won't compile

**Cause:** Missing FirebaseFirestore import

**Solution:**
```swift
import FirebaseFirestore  // Add this at top of file
```

---

### Issue 2: "Value of type 'Auth' has no member 'createUser'"

**Symptoms:**
- AuthService won't compile
- Auth methods not found

**Cause:** Missing FirebaseAuth import

**Solution:**
```swift
import FirebaseAuth  // Add this at top of AuthService.swift
```

---

### Issue 3: Auth State Listener Not Firing

**Symptoms:**
- User signs up but UI doesn't update
- `isAuthenticated` stays false

**Cause:** Listener not properly connected

**Solution:**
1. Check that `setupAuthStateListener()` is called in init
2. Verify `@MainActor` on AuthViewModel class
3. Check that AuthViewModel is added as `@EnvironmentObject`

**Debug Code:**
```swift
// Add to setupAuthStateListener
authStateHandle = Auth.auth().addStateDidChangeListener { [weak self] _, user in
    print("🔥 Auth state changed: \(user?.uid ?? "nil")") // Debug line
    Task { @MainActor in
        // ... rest of code
    }
}
```

---

### Issue 4: Firestore Document Not Created

**Symptoms:**
- User appears in Firebase Auth
- But no document in Firestore users collection

**Cause:** Error in createUserDocument method

**Solution:**
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore rules (should be test mode)
2. Add debug logging:
   ```swift
   private func createUserDocument(user: User) async throws {
       print("🔥 Creating Firestore doc for: \(user.id)")
       try await firebaseService.usersCollection
           .document(user.id)
           .setData(user.toDictionary())
       print("✅ Firestore doc created!")
   }
   ```
3. Check console for errors

---

### Issue 5: "Task was cancelled" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Async operations fail with cancellation error
- Sign up/sign in intermittently fails

**Cause:** View disappears before Task completes

**Solution:** This is usually not a real issue during testing. If it persists:
```swift
func signUp(...) async {
    do {
        try Task.checkCancellation() // Check if cancelled
        // ... rest of code
    } catch is CancellationError {
        print("Task cancelled, ignoring")
        return
    }
}
```

---

### Issue 6: Build Succeeds but Simulator Crashes

**Symptoms:**
- App builds fine
- Crashes immediately on launch

**Cause:** Likely Firebase not configured

**Solution:**
1. Check `GoogleService-Info.plist` is in project
2. Verify `FirebaseApp.configure()` in messAIApp.swift
3. Clean build folder: `⌘ + Shift + K`
4. Rebuild and run

---

### Issue 7: Test User Already Exists

**Symptoms:**
- Can't test sign up
- "Email already in use" error

**Cause:** Previous test left data in Firebase

**Solution:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
2. Find `test@example.com` user
3. Click three dots → Delete
4. Also delete from Firestore → users collection
5. Try again

**Or use different email:**
```swift
await authViewModel.signUp(
    email: "test2@example.com",  // Different email
    password: "password123",
    displayName: "Test User 2"
)
```

---

## Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: User Model (30 min)

**What You're Building:**
A Swift struct that represents a user and can convert to/from Firestore

**Key Concepts:**
- `Codable`: Automatic JSON encoding/decoding
- `Identifiable`: Needed for SwiftUI Lists
- `Equatable`: Needed for comparison
- Optional properties: Use `var photoURL: String?` for nullable fields

**Success Criteria:**
- User struct compiles
- Can create a User instance
- `toDictionary()` produces correct format
- `init(from:)` parses Firestore data

---

### Phase 2: FirebaseService (20 min)

**What You're Building:**
A base class that provides common Firestore utilities

**Key Concepts:**
- `CollectionReference`: Points to a Firestore collection
- Computed properties: Use `var usersCollection` for lazy access
- Reusability: Other services will use this base class

**Success Criteria:**
- FirebaseService compiles
- Can access `usersCollection`
- Helper methods available

---

### Phase 3: AuthService (60 min)

**What You're Building:**
A service that handles all Firebase Auth operations

**Key Concepts:**
- `async/await`: Modern Swift concurrency
- Error handling: Use `do-catch` with `async throws`
- Cleanup: Delete Auth user if Firestore fails
- Separation of concerns: Auth logic separate from UI

**Success Criteria:**
- Can sign up new users
- Can sign in existing users
- Can sign out
- Firestore documents created/updated
- Errors properly thrown

---

### Phase 4: AuthViewModel (60 min)

**What You're Building:**
A ViewModel that exposes auth state to SwiftUI views

**Key Concepts:**
- `@MainActor`: Ensures UI updates on main thread
- `ObservableObject`: Allows views to observe changes
- `@Published`: Automatically notifies views of changes
- Auth state listener: Automatically syncs with Firebase

**Success Criteria:**
- Can call signUp/signIn/signOut from UI
- `isAuthenticated` reflects current state
- `currentUser` populated when logged in
- Error messages displayed
- Loading states work

---

### Phase 5: Testing (30 min)

**What You're Doing:**
Testing the entire auth flow end-to-end

**Key Concepts:**
- Manual testing with test UI
- Verify Firebase Console matches app state
- Test both happy path and error cases

**Success Criteria:**
- All 6 test scenarios pass
- Firebase Auth shows users
- Firestore shows user documents
- Auth persists across app restarts

## Quick Reference

### Key Files Created

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `Models/User.swift` | User data model | ~120 |
| `Services/FirebaseService.swift` | Base Firestore service | ~60 |
| `Services/AuthService.swift` | Authentication logic | ~180 |
| `ViewModels/AuthViewModel.swift` | Auth state management | ~160 |

**Total**: ~520 lines of code

---

### Key Functions

**AuthService:**
- `signUp(email:password:displayName:)` - Create new user
- `signIn(email:password:)` - Log in user
- `signOut()` - Log out user
- `resetPassword(email:)` - Send reset email

**AuthViewModel:**
- `signUp(email:password:displayName:)` - UI-friendly signup
- `signIn(email:password:)` - UI-friendly signin
- `signOut()` - UI-friendly signout
- `isValidEmail(_:)` - Validate email format
- `isValidPassword(_:)` - Validate password strength

---

### Key Concepts

**Async/Await:**
```swift
// Old way (callbacks)
Auth.auth().createUser(withEmail: email, password: password) { result, error in
    // Handle result
}

// New way (async/await)
let result = try await Auth.auth().createUser(withEmail: email, password: password)
```

**Published Properties:**
```swift
@Published var isAuthenticated: Bool = false  // View auto-updates when this changes
```

**MainActor:**
```swift
@MainActor  // All methods in this class run on main thread (safe for UI)
class AuthViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // ...
}
```

**Firebase Timestamps:**
```swift
// Swift Date → Firestore Timestamp
let timestamp = Timestamp(date: Date())

// Firestore Timestamp → Swift Date
let date = timestamp.dateValue()
```

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**

- [ ] **User Creation**: Can tap "Sign Up" button and see user in Firebase Console
- [ ] **Firestore Sync**: User document appears in Firestore with all fields
- [ ] **UI Updates**: `isAuthenticated` changes to true, display name shows
- [ ] **Sign Out**: Can tap "Sign Out" and UI updates to signed-out state
- [ ] **Persistence**: Force quit and reopen app, still signed in
- [ ] **Errors**: Invalid inputs show error messages
- [ ] **No Crashes**: App stable throughout all tests

**Optimistic (experienced developer):** 2 hours
- User model: 20 min
- FirebaseService: 15 min
- AuthService: 45 min
