## What We're Building

### Foundation for All AI Features

**Core Components:**
1. **Firebase Cloud Functions** - Serverless backend infrastructure
2. **OpenAI Integration** - GPT-4 API with secure key management
3. **Authentication Layer** - Enforce user authentication for all AI requests
4. **Rate Limiting** - Protect against abuse (100 requests/hour/user)
5. **Feature Router** - Route to 6 AI features (calendar, decision, urgency, rsvp, deadline, agent)
6. **iOS AIService** - Type-safe Swift wrapper for Cloud Function calls
7. **AI Metadata Models** - Data structures for storing AI results in messages

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**No User-Visible Features:** This is pure infrastructure. Users won't see any changes yet.

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Cloud Functions (Server-Side AI)

**Choice:** Process AI on Cloud Functions, not client-side  
**Rationale:**
- **Security**: API keys secured on server (never in app binary)
- **Control**: Server-side rate limiting prevents abuse
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch AI models without app update
- **Cost Management**: Server can cache and batch optimize

**Impact:** Adds ~500ms network latency per AI call, but ensures security and cost control

---

### Decision 2: OpenAI GPT-4

**Choice:** Use OpenAI GPT-4 as primary AI model  
**Rationale:**
- **Function Calling**: Critical for structured JSON output (dates, RSVPs, etc.)
- **Quality**: Best-in-class for entity extraction and classification
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, proven at scale
- **Development Speed**: Excellent docs, many examples

**Impact:** Higher cost ($0.03/1K tokens) but best quality for our use cases

---

### Decision 3: TypeScript for Cloud Functions

**Choice:** Use TypeScript (not JavaScript) for Cloud Functions  
**Rationale:**
- **Type Safety**: Prevents runtime errors with OpenAI API types
- **Refactoring**: Safe to change code as features evolve
- **Self-Documentation**: Interfaces document expected data structures

**Impact:** Requires build step, but much safer and more maintainable

---

### Decision 4: Single Router Function

**Choice:** One Cloud Function with internal routing (not separate functions per feature)  
**Rationale:**
- **DRY**: Auth, rate limiting, error handling shared across all features
- **Consistency**: All features follow same patterns
- **Deployment**: Single deploy for all AI features
- **Cost**: Fewer function instances = lower Firebase costs

**Impact:** Slightly larger cold start (1-2 seconds), but much easier to maintain

---

### Decision 5: 100 Requests/Hour Rate Limit

**Choice:** Limit users to 100 AI requests per hour  
**Rationale:**
- **Budget**: ~$5-10/month for MVP testing (manageable)
- **Abuse Prevention**: Prevents API key theft exploitation
- **User Experience**: 100 req/hour = ~1 AI request per conversation per hour (reasonable)

**Impact:** Users can't spam AI features, but 100/hour is generous for normal use

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Timeline

**Phase 1: Cloud Functions Setup (30 min)**
- Initialize Firebase Cloud Functions

- Rate limiting middleware (Firestore-based counters)
- Validation middleware (check required fields)

**Phase 3: AI Router (60 min)**
- Create 6 placeholder functions (one per AI feature)
- Implement main router with feature routing
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Add logging for debugging

**Phase 4: iOS AIService (45 min)**
- Create AI metadata models
- Update Message model to include aiMetadata
- Implement AIService with caching
- Add error mapping

**Phase 5: Deploy & Test (30 min)**
- Deploy Cloud Functions to Firebase

- [ ] Total request time (iOS → Cloud → iOS): < 2 seconds
- [ ] Rate limit enforced at 100 req/hour/user
- [ ] Compilation: 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Qualitative
- [ ] Can call AI from iOS app

---

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: API Key Exposure 🔴 CRITICAL
**Issue:** OpenAI API key could be stolen if in iOS app  
**Mitigation:** 
- Use Cloud Functions (keys on server only)
- Environment variables (never hardcoded)
- .env file in .gitignore
- Regular git history audits
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated (keys secured server-side)

---

### Risk 2: Rate Limit Bypass 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Users could bypass rate limits if client-side  
**Mitigation:**
- Server-side rate limiting (can't be bypassed)
- Firestore counters per user per hour
- Alert if any user exceeds 200 req/hour
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated (server enforced)

---

### Risk 3: Cold Start Latency 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Cloud Functions take 1-3 seconds on first call  
**Mitigation:**
- Show loading states in UI
- Cache results for 5 minutes
- Consider min instances=1 for production ($0.20/day)
**Status:** ⚠️ Accept for MVP (optimize later if needed)

---

### Risk 4: OpenAI API Costs 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** AI calls cost $0.03/1K tokens  
**Mitigation:**
- Rate limiting caps max usage
- Caching reduces duplicate calls
- Budget alert at $50/month
- Monitor cost per user
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated (budget-manageable for MVP)

## Hot Tips for Implementation

### Tip 1: Set Up Environment Variables First
**Why:** Can't test anything without OpenAI API key. Get this working ASAP.

```bash
# Get key from platform.openai.com
# Add to functions/.env
# Set Firebase config
# Verify it's in .gitignore
```

### Tip 2: Test After Each Phase
**Why:** Catch issues early. Don't wait until the end.

- After middleware: Test compilation
- After router: Test deployment
- After iOS: Test end-to-end

### Tip 3: Use Console Logging Liberally
**Why:** Cloud Functions debugging is hard without good logs.

```typescript
functions.logger.info('AI request received', { userId, feature });
functions.logger.error('AI request failed', { error, userId });
```

### Tip 4: Cache Everything
**Why:** Reduce costs and improve speed.

- iOS caches results for 5 minutes
- Consider caching common requests server-side
- Clear cache during development/testing

### Tip 5: Start with Placeholders
**Why:** Get infrastructure working before implementing complex AI logic.

All AI features return placeholder responses in PR #14. Actual implementations come in PRs #15-20.

## Go / No-Go Decision

### Go If:
- ✅ You have 2-3 hours available
- ✅ OpenAI API account created (can do in 5 minutes)
- ✅ Firebase billing enabled
- ✅ Excited to build AI features
- ✅ Core messaging complete (PRs 1-13)

### No-Go If:
- ❌ Time-constrained (<2 hours available)
- ❌ Can't get OpenAI API key
- ❌ Firebase billing disabled
- ❌ Core messaging not complete

**Decision Aid:** This is CRITICAL for all AI features. Without this infrastructure, PRs #15-20 can't be built. If you're building AI features, this must be done first.
