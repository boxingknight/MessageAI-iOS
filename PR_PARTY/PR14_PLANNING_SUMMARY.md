## What We're Building

### 4 Major Components

| Component | Purpose | Time | Priority |
|-----------|---------|------|----------|
| **ImageCompressor** | Compress images to <2MB, generate thumbnails | 30 min | CRITICAL |
| **StorageService** | Upload/download images from Firebase Storage | 45 min | CRITICAL |
| **Image Display** | Show thumbnails in chat, full-screen with zoom | 60 min | HIGH |
| **Image Input** | Select from library/camera, send button | 30 min | HIGH |

**Total Time:** 2-3 hours for complete implementation

---

### User Flow (What Users Experience)

```
1. User in conversation
2. Tap image button (+)
3. Action sheet: "Photo Library" or "Camera"
4. Select source → Picker opens
5. Select/capture image → Picker closes
6. Image compresses (1-2 seconds, automatic)
7. Upload starts → Progress 0-100% (5-10 seconds)
8. Thumbnail appears in chat immediately
9. Message status: sending → sent → delivered → read
10. Recipient receives thumbnail within 2 seconds
11. Tap thumbnail → Full-screen modal opens
12. Pinch to zoom 1x-5x
13. Tap Done → Back to chat
```

**Key UX Principles:**
- **Instant Feedback:** Thumbnail shows immediately (optimistic UI)
- **Progress Visibility:** 0-100% upload progress
- **No Waiting:** User can continue chatting while image uploads
- **Familiar Interaction:** Standard iOS image picker
- **Natural Gestures:** Pinch-to-zoom like Photos app

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Firebase Storage for Image Backend
**Choice:** Use Firebase Storage (not Firestore Base64 or third-party CDN)

**Rationale:**
- Integrated with existing Firebase project
- Secure with built-in auth and rules
- Scalable to millions of images automatically
- Global CDN for fast downloads
- Free tier sufficient for MVP (5GB storage, 1GB/day bandwidth)
- Simple SDK, well-documented

**Impact:** 
- Need to enable Storage in Firebase Console (1-click)
- Need to write storage.rules for security
- Slightly higher complexity than Base64, but much better performance
- Small cost at scale (~$2.60/month for 100GB storage)

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gain:** Reliable, scalable, integrated, performant
- **Lose:** Small cost at scale (acceptable)

---

### Decision 2: Client-Side Compression
**Choice:** Compress images on device before upload (not server-side)

**Rationale:**
- Fast local compression (<2 seconds)
- No Cloud Functions needed (saves money and complexity)
- Instant thumbnail preview (good UX)
- Works offline (compress locally, upload later)
- Full control over compression quality and size

**Impact:**
- Need ImageCompressor utility class (~150 lines)
- Small CPU/battery usage on device (acceptable for image operations)
- Users see compression happen immediately
- Upload times reduced 5-10x (2MB vs 10-20MB originals)

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gain:** Fast, free, good UX, offline-capable
- **Lose:** Small battery usage (acceptable)

---

### Decision 3: Conversation-Based Storage Structure
**Choice:** Store images as `/chat_images/{conversationId}/{messageId}.jpg`

**Rationale:**
- Logical organization (images belong to conversations)
- Easy permission enforcement (conversation participants can access)
- Cleanup-friendly (delete conversation → delete all images)
- Debugging easier (can browse by conversation)

**Impact:**
- Slightly longer file paths
- Need to pass conversationId to upload function
- Security rules check conversation participants

**Alternative Considered:** Flat `/images/{messageId}.jpg` structure
- Simpler, shorter paths
- But: Harder to organize, cleanup, and secure

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gain:** Better organization, security, cleanup
- **Lose:** Slightly more complex paths (acceptable)

---

### Decision 4: UIKit Image Picker (Not SwiftUI PhotosPicker)
**Choice:** Use UIImagePickerController wrapped in UIViewControllerRepresentable

**Rationale:**
- Works on iOS 16.0+ (our minimum)
- Battle-tested, mature, reliable
- Supports both photo library AND camera
- Simple wrapper (~80 lines)
- Industry-standard pattern

**Alternative Considered:** SwiftUI PhotosPicker (iOS 16+)
- Pure SwiftUI, more modern
- But: Newer, less battle-tested
- Doesn't support camera natively

**Impact:**
- Need UIKit wrapper (20 lines of boilerplate)
- Small mixing of UIKit and SwiftUI (acceptable pattern)

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gain:** Reliability, camera support, compatibility
- **Lose:** Not "pure SwiftUI" (acceptable)

---

### Decision 5: Progress Bar (Not Silent Upload)
**Choice:** Show 0-100% upload progress with visual indicator

**Rationale:**
- User confidence (see it happening)
- Essential for slow networks (3G, poor connections)
- Perception of speed (progress makes it feel faster)
- Industry standard (WhatsApp, iMessage, Telegram all show progress)

**Alternative Considered:** Silent background upload
- Simpler implementation
- But: User doesn't know what's happening, feels broken on slow networks

**Impact:**
- Need progress state in ChatViewModel (@Published Double)
- Need progress handler in StorageService upload
- Need UI component to show progress (circular ring or linear bar)

**Trade-offs:**
- **Gain:** Clear user feedback, handles slow networks well
- **Lose:** Slightly more complex implementation (worth it)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Approach (7 Phases)

**Why Phases?**
- Break complex feature into manageable chunks
- Each phase has clear goal and checkpoint
- Test incrementally (catch bugs early)
- Can stop early if time-constrained

**Phase Breakdown:**

```
Phase 1: Image Utilities (45 min)
├─ ImageCompressor (compress, resize, thumbnail)
├─ ImagePicker (UIKit wrapper)
└─ Checkpoint: Can select and compress images ✓

Phase 2: Storage Service (60 min)
├─ StorageService (upload, download, delete)
├─ Firebase Storage rules
└─ Checkpoint: Images upload to Firebase ✓

Phase 3: Model Updates (30 min)
├─ Message model (add image fields)
├─ Firestore conversion
└─ Checkpoint: Image messages save to Firestore ✓

Phase 4: ViewModel Integration (45 min)
├─ ChatViewModel.sendImageMessage()
├─ Upload progress tracking
└─ Checkpoint: ViewModel can upload images ✓

Phase 5: UI Components (60 min)
├─ MessageBubbleView (display thumbnails)
├─ FullScreenImageView (zoom viewer)
└─ Checkpoint: Images display and zoom ✓

Phase 6: Input Updates (30 min)
├─ MessageInputView (image button)
├─ ChatView integration
└─ Checkpoint: Can send images from chat ✓

Phase 7: Testing & Polish (30 min)
├─ Comprehensive testing
├─ Error handling
├─ Performance check
└─ Checkpoint: Production-ready ✓
```

**Total:** ~4.5 hours budgeted, expect 2-3 hours actual (historical 2-3x speedup)

### Key Implementation Principles

1. **Test After Each Phase**
   - Don't move to next phase until current works
   - Catch bugs early when context is fresh
   - Each phase builds on previous

2. **Commit Frequently**
   - Commit after each phase completion
   - Clear commit messages (feat, fix, docs)
   - Easy to revert if needed

3. **Code Examples in Spec**
   - Don't guess implementation details
   - Copy-paste from spec, adapt as needed
   - Spec has battle-tested code patterns

4. **Focus on User Experience**
   - Images should "just work"
   - Progress feedback essential
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Fast compression and upload

5. **Security First**
   - Deploy storage.rules immediately
   - Only participants can access images
   - Test rules with Firebase Emulator or manual tests

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### Risk 1: Upload Times on Slow Networks 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Images take 30+ seconds on 3G  
**Mitigation:**
- Aggressive compression (2MB max)
- Show clear progress (users wait if they see progress)
- Non-blocking (can send text while uploading)
- Queue for background upload
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

---

### Risk 2: Firebase Storage Costs 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Storage costs money at scale  
**Mitigation:**
- Compress to <2MB (reduce storage 5-10x)
- Use thumbnails in chat (reduce bandwidth)
- Free tier covers MVP (5GB storage, 1GB/day bandwidth)
- Monitor usage in Firebase Console
**Cost Estimate:** ~$2.60/month for 100GB storage  
**Status:** ✅ Acceptable for MVP

---

### Risk 3: Memory Usage (Large Images) 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Loading many images causes memory pressure  
**Mitigation:**
- Use thumbnails in chat (200x200, <50KB)
- AsyncImage lazy loads (automatic)
- Unload off-screen images
- Profile with Instruments
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated via thumbnails

---

### Risk 4: Permission Denials 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Users deny camera/photo permissions  
**Mitigation:**
- Clear Info.plist descriptions
- Graceful error messages
- Guide to Settings if denied
- Offer both camera and library (redundancy)
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

---

### Risk 5: Invalid/Corrupt Images 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** User selects invalid image  
**Mitigation:**
- Validate UIImage is not nil
- Catch compression failures
- Clear error messages
- Allow retry
**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

---

## Hot Tips

### Tip 1: Test Compression Early
**Why:** Compression is critical - if it doesn't work, nothing else matters  
**How:** Create large test image (4000x3000), compress, verify <2MB  
**When:** Phase 1, before moving to Phase 2

---

### Tip 2: Deploy Rules Immediately
**Why:** Can't test uploads without rules  
**How:** `firebase deploy --only storage` after writing rules  
**When:** Phase 2, before testing uploads

---

### Tip 3: Use Physical Device for Camera
**Why:** Simulator has no camera  
**How:** Connect iPhone, select in Xcode, run (Cmd+R)  
**When:** Phase 6, when testing camera picker

---

### Tip 4: Monitor Firebase Console
**Why:** See uploads happening in real-time, catch errors  
**How:** Open Firebase Console > Storage > Files while testing  
**When:** Throughout Phase 2 and beyond

---

### Tip 5: Test with Poor Network
**Why:** Most bugs appear on slow connections  
**How:** Settings > Developer > Network Link Conditioner > 3G  
**When:** Phase 7, final testing

---

## Go / No-Go Decision

### ✅ GO If:
- You have 2-3 hours available this session
- PRs #4, #5, #9, #10, #11 complete (core messaging works)
- Firebase Storage enabled in Console
- Excited about visual communication
- Want feature-complete MVP
- **Recommendation:** GO! Images are essential for modern messaging.

### ❌ NO-GO If:
- Time-constrained (<2 hours)
- Core messaging not working (do PR #9-11 first)
- Firebase Storage not configured
- Other critical priorities (bugs, performance)
- Prefer to polish existing features first
- **Recommendation:** Defer to after PR #15 or #13.

### 🤔 MAYBE (Consider These):
- **Have 1-2 hours?** Do Phases 1-3 only (compression + storage), finish later
- **Want simpler version?** Skip camera support, only photo library
- **Want faster version?** Skip full-screen zoom, just show full image
- **Testing constrained?** Skip cross-device tests, do manual only
