## Bug #1: Missing Firestore Composite Index

### Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL
**Time to Find:** 2 minutes (immediate on first test)  
**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes  
**Impact:** Feature completely broken - no queries could execute

### The Issue

**What Happened:**
First test of summarization feature resulted in immediate error:
```
FAILED_PRECONDITION: The query requires an index.
```

**Error Log:**
```
Error: 9 FAILED_PRECONDITION: The query requires an index. 
You can create it here: https://console.firebase.google.com/...
```

**User Impact:**
- 100% of summarization requests failed
- Generic "INTERNAL" error shown to users
- No summary could be generated

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Firestore query was rejected due to missing index.

**Actual Cause:**
The Cloud Function query combined `where()` + `orderBy()` which requires a composite index in Firestore:

```typescript
.collection('messages')
.where('conversationId', '==', conversationId)  // ← Filter
.orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')                   // ← Sort (requires index!)
.limit(50)
```

Firestore's automatic indexing only handles single-field queries. Multi-field queries (filter + sort) require explicit composite indexes.

**Why This Happened:**
- Planning docs didn't anticipate composite index requirement
- Initial implementation assumed simple queries
- Firestore index creation is a separate deployment step

### The Fix

**Solution:** Add composite index to `firestore.indexes.json`

```json
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "messages",
      "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
      "fields": [
        {
          "fieldPath": "conversationId",
          "order": "ASCENDING"
        },
        {
          "fieldPath": "timestamp",
          "order": "DESCENDING"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Deployment:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**Result:**
✅ Index created and built (2-5 minutes)  
✅ Queries could now execute

**Files Changed:**
- `firebase/firestore.indexes.json` (+16/-1 lines)

**Commit:** `fix(pr16): add required Firestore index for message queries`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid in Future:**
1. **Plan indexes during design phase** - Document required queries and indexes
2. **Test with real data early** - Catch index issues before full implementation
3. **Use Firebase Console** - Review index suggestions during development
4. **Add to deployment checklist** - Include index deployment in PR completion steps

**Lesson Learned:**
Always consider Firestore index requirements when planning queries with multiple fields. Add indexes to `firestore.indexes.json` before deploying Cloud Functions.

## Bug #2: Wrong Firestore Collection Path

### Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL
**Time to Find:** 5 minutes (after fixing Bug #1)  
**Time to Fix:** 10 minutes  
**Impact:** Feature broken - no messages found

### The Issue

**What Happened:**
After fixing the index, summarization still failed with:
```
No messages found in this conversation.
```

Even though the conversation had 50+ messages visible in the app.

**Error Log:**
```
Error: No messages found in this conversation.
conversationId: "27A8D951-4B63-44DA-AA27-F17B20602C1A"
messagesSnapshot.empty: true
```

**User Impact:**
- 100% of summarization requests failed
- Confusing error message (messages exist but "not found")
- No indication of root cause

### Root Cause Analysis

**Surface Issue:**
Firestore query returning empty results.

**Actual Cause:**
Messages are stored in **subcollections** under each conversation:
```
conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}
```

But the Cloud Function was querying a **top-level collection**:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Top-level collection (doesn't exist)
db.collection('messages')
  .where('conversationId', '==', conversationId)
```

**Why This Happened:**
- Cloud Function developer (me) assumed flat collection structure
- iOS app uses hierarchical subcollection structure (best practice)
- Firestore security rules hinted at this but weren't reviewed

**Evidence from Security Rules:**
```javascript
// conversations/{conversationId}
match /conversations/{conversationId} {
  // Messages subcollection ← This revealed the structure!
  match /messages/{messageId} {
    allow read: if isParticipant(conversationId);
  }
}
```

### The Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const messagesSnapshot = await db
  .collection('messages')  // ❌ Top-level (doesn't exist)
  .where('conversationId', '==', conversationId)
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .limit(50)
  .get();
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const messagesSnapshot = await db
  .collection('conversations')
  .doc(conversationId)
  .collection('messages')  // ✅ Subcollection!
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .limit(50)
  .get();
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Removed top-level `messages` collection
2. Added `conversations/{conversationId}/` path
3. Removed `where('conversationId')` filter (implicit in subcollection)
4. Removed composite index (no longer needed for single-field orderBy)

**Result:**
✅ Query now targets correct subcollection  
✅ Messages found successfully

**Files Changed:**
- `functions/src/ai/decisionSummary.ts` (+3/-2 lines)
- `firebase/firestore.indexes.json` (removed composite index)

**Commit:** `fix(pr16): correct Firestore query path for messages subcollection`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid in Future:**
1. **Review security rules first** - They document data structure
2. **Check iOS data models** - Verify Firestore paths match app structure
3. **Test queries in Firebase Console** - Validate paths before coding
4. **Document data structure** - Add schema diagrams to planning docs

**Lesson Learned:**
Always review the existing data structure (security rules, iOS models) before implementing Cloud Functions. Subcollections require different query paths than top-level collections.

## Bug #3: Field Name Mismatch (timestamp vs sentAt)

### Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL (Root Cause)
**Time to Find:** 15 minutes (deep code analysis)  
**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes  
**Impact:** Feature broken - query returned empty even after path fix

### The Issue

**What Happened:**
Even after fixing the collection path (Bug #2), the error persisted:
```
No messages found in this conversation.
```

Required **deep dive investigation** to find root cause.

**Error Pattern:**
- Query targeting correct subcollection ✅
- Conversation has 50+ messages ✅
- Query returns empty 🔴

**User Impact:**
- 100% of summarization requests still failed
- No error provided insight into the problem
- Appeared to be same as Bug #2 (confusing!)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Investigation Process:**

1. **Checked Cloud Function logs** - Query executing but returning empty
2. **Reviewed Firestore security rules** - Permissions correct
3. **Examined iOS Message model** - **FOUND IT!**

**Surface Issue:**
Query syntax appeared correct but returned no results.

**Actual Cause:**
Field name mismatch between iOS app and Cloud Function:

**iOS App (Message.swift line 239):**
```swift
func toDictionary() -> [String: Any] {
    var dict: [String: Any] = [
        "sentAt": Timestamp(date: sentAt),  // ← Field name: sentAt
        // ...
    ]
}
```

**Cloud Function (decisionSummary.ts line 72):**
```typescript
.orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')  // ❌ Field name: timestamp (doesn't exist!)
```

**Why This Happened:**
- iOS app was implemented first using `sentAt` field
- Cloud Function developer assumed standard field name `timestamp`
- No cross-reference between iOS models and Cloud Function
- TypeScript has no compile-time check for Firestore field names

**Evidence Trail:**
```typescript
// Line 91 also referenced wrong field
timestamp: data.timestamp?.toDate().toISOString()  // ❌
```

Two locations in the code both used the wrong field name.

### The Fix

**Solution Evaluation:**

We considered 4 solutions:

| Solution | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| 1. Fix Cloud Function | ✅ One-line change<br>✅ No migration<br>✅ Matches iOS | None | ✅ **CHOSEN** |
| 2. Add both fields | ✅ Backwards compatible | ❌ Redundant data<br>❌ Requires iOS changes | ❌ Rejected |
| 3. Change iOS app | ✅ Matches Cloud Function | ❌ Breaks existing data<br>❌ Migration required | ❌ Rejected |
| 4. Try both fields | ✅ Works either way | ❌ Complex<br>❌ Slower | ❌ Rejected |

**Best Solution: Fix Cloud Function (Option 1)**

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// Line 72
.orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')  // ❌

// Line 91
timestamp: data.timestamp?.toDate().toISOString()  // ❌
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Line 72
.orderBy('sentAt', 'desc')  // ✅

// Line 91
timestamp: data.sentAt?.toDate().toISOString()  // ✅
```

**Result:**
✅ Query now uses correct field name  
✅ Messages found successfully  
✅ **FEATURE WORKING!** 🎉

**Files Changed:**
- `functions/src/ai/decisionSummary.ts` (+2/-2 lines)

**Commit:** `fix(pr16): correct field name from 'timestamp' to 'sentAt'`

### Prevention Strategy

**How to Avoid in Future:**
1. **Document field names in planning** - Create data dictionary
2. **Code review iOS models first** - Verify field names before Cloud Function
3. **Create TypeScript types** - Define Firestore document interfaces
4. **Add integration tests** - Catch field mismatches early
5. **Use shared constants** - Define field names in one place

**Example Prevention Code:**
```typescript
// Shared types (could be in separate file)
interface MessageDocument {
  id: string;
  conversationId: string;
  senderId: string;
  text: string;
  sentAt: FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp;  // ← Explicit field name
  // ...
}

// Usage in Cloud Function
const data = doc.data() as MessageDocument;
const timestamp = data.sentAt.toDate();  // ← Type-safe!
```

**Lesson Learned:**
Always create a data dictionary or shared type definitions when implementing features across platforms. TypeScript types can catch field name mismatches at compile time rather than runtime.
