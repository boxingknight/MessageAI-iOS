# PR #1: Project Setup & Firebase Configuration - Quick Start

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What**: Set up Xcode project with Firebase backend integration

**Why**: Creates the foundation for all messaging features - authentication, real-time database, file storage, and push notifications

**Time**: 1-2 hours

**Complexity**: LOW (straightforward configuration, well-documented process)

**Status**: 📋 PLANNING COMPLETE → Ready to implement

---

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This Now?

**Build it if:**
- ✅ You have 1-2 hours available
- ✅ You have a Google account (for Firebase)
- ✅ You have stable internet connection
- ✅ Xcode is installed and working
- ✅ You're ready to start the project
- ✅ You want to see Firebase working quickly

**Skip/defer it if:**
- ❌ You don't have time right now (<1 hour available)
- ❌ Internet connection is unstable
- ❌ Xcode issues need to be resolved first
- ❌ You need to review architecture first

**Decision Aid**: 

This is **PR #1** - the foundation. You **must** do this before any other PR. It's also the easiest PR to complete, so it's a great confidence builder to start the project.

**Recommendation**: ✅ **DO IT NOW** - It's quick, straightforward, and blocks all other work.

## Prerequisites (5 minutes)

### Required
- [ ] Xcode 15+ installed
- [ ] macOS with admin access
- [ ] Google account (for Firebase Console)
- [ ] Internet connection (stable, for downloading Firebase SDK)
- [ ] Git repository initialized (✅ already done)
- [ ] GitHub connected (✅ already done)

### Knowledge Required
- Basic Xcode navigation
- Understanding of what Firebase is (we'll guide you through setup)
- Basic terminal/command line usage

### Setup Commands (if needed)
```bash
# Verify Xcode is installed
xcode-select -p
# Should show: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Verify git is working
git --version
# Should show version number

# Verify you're in project directory
pwd
# Should show: .../messAI
```

---

## Getting Started (First Hour)

### Step 1: Read Documentation (45 minutes)

**Priority Order:**
1. **This quick start** (10 min) - You're here! ✅
2. **Main specification** (`PR01_PROJECT_SETUP.md`) (30 min)
   - Focus on: Overview, Technical Design decisions, Implementation Details
   - Skim: Testing Strategy (you'll refer back during testing)
3. **Implementation checklist** (`PR01_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`) (5 min)
   - Just read through once to familiarize
   - You'll use this step-by-step during implementation

**Key Questions to Answer While Reading:**
- What Firebase services are we enabling?
  - **Answer**: Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging
- What's the bundle identifier?
  - **Answer**: `com.isaacjaramillo.messAI` (or your choice)
- What folders are we creating?
  - **Answer**: Models, ViewModels, Views, Services, Persistence, Utilities
- What gets committed to git?
  - **Answer**: Code, but NOT GoogleService-Info.plist (gitignored)

### Step 2: Prepare Environment (5 minutes)

- [ ] Close unnecessary apps (free up RAM for Xcode + Simulator)
- [ ] Open Xcode with messAI project
- [ ] Open Terminal in project directory
- [ ] Have Firebase Console ready in browser: https://console.firebase.google.com
- [ ] Have this checklist open for reference

### Step 3: Create Feature Branch (1 minute)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/project-setup
git status  # Verify you're on the new branch
```

### Step 4: Start Implementation (10 minutes - first checkpoint)

Open `PR01_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` and begin with Phase 1:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Create new project
3. Register iOS app
4. Download GoogleService-Info.plist

**First Checkpoint Goal**: Firebase project created with iOS app registered

**Time Check**: Should reach this in ~10 minutes

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Firebase SDK Taking Too Long to Download

**Symptoms**: SPM package resolution stuck for 10+ minutes

**Cause**: Large Firebase SDK, slow internet, or Xcode cache issues

**Solution**:
```swift
// 1. Cancel package addition
// 2. Try again with specific version
File → Add Package Dependencies
URL: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
Dependency Rule: Exact Version → 10.0.0
```

**Alternative**:
```bash
# Reset package caches
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
# Reopen Xcode and try again
```

---

### Issue 2: "Could not find GoogleService-Info.plist"

**Symptoms**: Build error or Firebase not initializing

**Cause**: File not in correct location or not in build target

**Solution**:
1. Verify file location: Should be in `messAI/` folder (same level as messAIApp.swift)
2. Check target membership:
   - Select GoogleService-Info.plist in Project Navigator
   - File Inspector (right sidebar)
   - Target Membership: ✅ messAI should be checked

---

### Issue 3: "No such module 'FirebaseCore'"

**Symptoms**: Build error on `import FirebaseCore`

**Cause**: Firebase packages not added correctly

**Solution**:
1. Check Project → messAI target → General → Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content
2. Should see: FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore, FirebaseStorage, FirebaseMessaging
3. If missing:
   - File → Add Package Dependencies
   - Add firebase-ios-sdk again
   - Select missing products

---

### Issue 4: Firebase Console Shows Wrong Bundle ID

**Symptoms**: Want to change bundle ID after registering app

**Solution**:
1. Firebase Console → Project Settings → General
2. Under "Your apps" → iOS app
3. Can delete and re-register if needed
4. **Or** just change in Xcode to match Firebase (easier)

---

### Issue 5: Firestore Write Test Fails

**Symptoms**: Console shows error, no document in Firebase

**Cause**: Firestore not in test mode, or internet connection issue

**Solution**:
1. Check Firestore rules:
   ```
   Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules tab
   Should show:
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 11, 20);
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. If not in test mode, click "Edit rules" and set to test mode
3. Publish rules

### Key Concepts

**Firebase Services:**
- **Authentication**: User signup/login
- **Firestore**: Real-time NoSQL database
- **Storage**: File storage (images)
- **Cloud Messaging**: Push notifications

**Test Mode**:
- Firestore: Read/write allowed for 30 days
- Storage: Read/write allowed for 30 days
- ⚠️ **Security risk**: Only for development
- Will add security rules in PR #5

**Bundle Identifier**:
- Format: `com.developer.appname`
- Must be unique (for App Store)
- Must match between Xcode and Firebase

---

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**

- [ ] **Firebase Console**: Shows iOS app registered
- [ ] **Xcode Console**: Shows Firebase initialization log:
  ```
  [Firebase/Core][I-COR000003] The default Firebase app has been configured.
  ```
- [ ] **Build**: Succeeds with 0 errors
- [ ] **Run**: App launches without crashing
- [ ] **Optional Test**: Document appears in Firebase Firestore after test button tap

**Performance Targets:**
- Total time: 1-2 hours
- Firebase setup: ~30 minutes
- Xcode config: ~30 minutes
- Structure & docs: ~30 minutes
- Testing: ~10 minutes
