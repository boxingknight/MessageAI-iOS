# PR#17: Push Notifications - Quick Start Guide

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

**What:** Push notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging - the **final MVP requirement**

**Why:** Without notifications, users miss messages when app is closed. This is what makes it a real messaging app.

**Time:** 3-4 hours

**Complexity:** HIGH (APNs certificates, Cloud Functions, physical device testing)

**Status:** üìã PLANNED (ready to implement!)

**Impact:** üî• **CRITICAL** - This completes your MVP! You'll have all 10 requirements done.

---

## Decision Framework (2 minutes)

### Should You Build This Now?

**Build it NOW if:** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ You want to complete your MVP (this is requirement #10)
- ‚úÖ You have a physical iPhone available (simulator can't test push)
- ‚úÖ You have 3-4 hours available for focused work
- ‚úÖ You have Apple Developer account access
- ‚úÖ Firebase is on Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go for Cloud Functions)
- ‚úÖ You're excited to ship a complete messaging app!

**Defer it if:** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚ùå No physical device available (absolutely required for testing)
- ‚ùå No Apple Developer account (need for APNs certificates)
- ‚ùå Firebase on Spark plan (need Blaze for Cloud Functions)
- ‚ùå Less than 3 hours available (needs focused time)

### Why This Is Critical

**This is the difference between a demo and a product.**

Before PR #17:
- Users can message... if they keep the app open
- No way to know when someone messages you
- Have to manually check app constantly
- Feels incomplete and broken

After PR #17:
- Get notified immediately when someone messages
- Works even when app is closed
- Badge shows unread count
- Tap notification ‚Üí Jump to conversation
- **Feels professional and production-quality**

**Bottom Line:** This is your last MVP feature. After this, you can submit to TestFlight and show off a real messaging app!

firebase login      # Authenticate
```

### Step 3: Start Phase 1 (Create APNs Key)

**Now you're ready!** Follow the implementation checklist starting with Phase 1.

**Estimated time for Phase 1:** 30 minutes (creating and uploading APNs key)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### The 10-Phase Approach

This PR is broken into 10 manageable phases:

```
Phase 1: APNs Configuration (30 min)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Create APNs key in Apple Developer

  ‚îî‚îÄ> Add Background Modes capability
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Update Info.plist

Phase 3: AppDelegate (30 min)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Create AppDelegate.swift
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Handle APNs token
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Handle FCM token
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Handle notification tap

Phase 4: NotificationService (45 min)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Permission management
  ‚îî‚îÄ> FCM token storage
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Badge management
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Deep linking

Phase 5: ChatService Update (15 min)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Add getUnreadConversationCount()

Phase 6: Integration (20 min)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Configure NotificationService on launch
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Track active conversation
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Remove token on sign out
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Handle deep link navigation

  ‚îî‚îÄ> Deploy to Firebase

Phase 8: Device Testing (30 min)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Test foreground notification
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Test background notification
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Test closed app notification
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Test deep linking
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Test badge count

Phase 9: Polish (15 min)
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Handle edge cases
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Test permission denial

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No provisioning profile found"

**Symptoms:**
- Xcode error when building to device
- "Signing for 'messAI' requires a development team"

**Solution:**
```
1. Xcode ‚Üí Select messAI target
2. Signing & Capabilities tab
3. Team: Select your Apple Developer account
4. Xcode auto-generates provisioning profile
5. Build again
```

**Prevention:** Ensure device is registered in Apple Developer portal

---

### Issue 2: "Failed to register for remote notifications"

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows: "Failed to register for remote notifications: [error]"
- No APNs token received

**Cause:** Push Notifications capability not added OR device not connected to internet

**Solution:**
```
1. Verify Push Notifications capability added in Xcode
2. Check device has WiFi or cellular connection
3. Restart app
4. Check Apple Developer portal for certificate issues
```

---

### Issue 3: FCM Token Not Appearing in Firestore

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows FCM token received
- But token not saved to Firestore users document

**Cause:** User not logged in when token received, OR Firestore rules blocking update

**Solution:**
```swift
// Check console for logs:
// "‚úÖ FCM token saved to Firestore for user: [userId]"

// If not appearing:
1. Verify user is logged in (check authService.currentUser)
2. Check Firestore rules allow users to update own document
3. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Users collection
4. Try signing out and signing back in
```

**Debug:**
```swift
// Add to NotificationService.saveFCMTokenToFirestore():
print("Current user ID: \(authService?.currentUser?.id ?? "nil")")
print("Attempting to save token: \(token)")
```

---

### Issue 4: Notifications Not Received

**Symptoms:**
- Messages sent but no notification appears
- Cloud Function executes (check logs) but nothing on device

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

**1. Check APNs Configuration (Firebase Console)**
```
Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
- APNs Authentication Key should show "Uploaded"
- Key ID and Team ID should be filled
```

**2. Check FCM Token Exists (Firestore)**
```
Firestore ‚Üí users ‚Üí [your-user-id]
- fcmToken: "dP1KX4gp3k:APA91bH..." ‚Üê Should exist
- notificationsEnabled: true
```

**3. Check Device Permission (iOS Settings)**
```
iOS Settings ‚Üí MessageAI ‚Üí Notifications
- Should show "Allow Notifications" ON
- Banner style, sounds, badges enabled
```

**4. Check Cloud Function Logs (Firebase Console)**
```
Firebase Console ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Logs
Should see:
- üì¨ New message detected: [messageId]
- ‚úÖ Notification sent to [recipientId]

If you see:
- ‚ùå Failed to send: [error]
  ‚Üí Token might be invalid
  ‚Üí Check APNs configuration
```

**5. Test with Firebase Console**
```
Firebase Console ‚Üí Cloud Messaging ‚Üí Send test message
- Enter FCM token (from Firestore)
- Send notification
- Should appear on device immediately

If this works, problem is in Cloud Function
If this doesn't work, problem is APNs or device configuration
```

---

### Issue 5: "Permission denied" When Deploying Cloud Functions

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: HTTP Error: 403, Permission denied
```

**Cause:** Firebase project is on Spark (free) plan, not Blaze

**Solution:**
```
1. Firebase Console ‚Üí Upgrade
2. Select "Blaze" (pay-as-you-go)
3. Add payment method
4. Try deploying again:
   firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Cost Note:** Free tier includes 2M invocations/month. For MVP testing, cost is $0-1/month.

---

### Issue 6: Deep Link Not Working (Notification Tap Doesn't Open Conversation)

**Symptoms:**
- Tap notification ‚Üí App opens to chat list (not specific conversation)
- Console shows deep link received but nothing happens

**Cause:** Navigation not wired up correctly in ChatListView

**Solution:**
```swift
// In ChatListView.swift, verify this exists:
.onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: NSNotification.Name("OpenConversation"))) { notification in
    guard let userInfo = notification.userInfo,
          let conversationId = userInfo["conversationId"] as? String else {
        return
    }
    
    // Find and navigate to conversation
    if let conversation = viewModel.conversations.first(where: { $0.id == conversationId }) {
        // TODO: Set your navigation selection here
        // Example:
        self.selectedConversation = conversation
        self.isNavigatingToConversation = true
    }
}
```

**Debug:**
```
Check console for:
"üëÜ Notification tapped: [conversationId: abc123]"
"üîó Deep link received: messageai://conversation/abc123"
"üì± Opening conversation: abc123"

If logs appear, deep link is working - just need to wire up navigation
```

---

### Issue 7: Badge Count Shows Wrong Number

**Symptoms:**
- Badge shows "5" but only 2 unread conversations
- Or badge doesn't update when reading messages

**Cause:** Badge calculation logic out of sync with actual unread state

**Solution:**
```swift
// Force badge refresh:
Task {
    await NotificationService.shared.updateBadgeCount()
}

// Add this to ChatView.onDisappear:
.onDisappear {
    // Update badge when leaving conversation
    Task {
        await NotificationService.shared.updateBadgeCount()
    }
}
```

**Verify Logic:**
```swift
// ChatService.getUnreadConversationCount() should:
1. Get all conversations with current user as participant
2. For each conversation, check if lastMessage exists
3. If lastMessage.senderId != currentUserId
4. AND currentUserId not in lastMessage.readBy
5. Then increment unreadCount

// Test by adding print statements:
print("Total conversations: \(snapshot.documents.count)")
print("Unread count: \(unreadCount)")
```
