## 🎯 The 5 AI Features Explained

### 1. Calendar Extraction ⭐
**Problem:** Parents miss events buried in 100+ message threads  
**Solution:** AI auto-detects dates, one-tap adds to iOS Calendar  
**Example:** "Practice Thursday 3pm" → Calendar event  
**Value:** Never miss practice, games, doctor appointments

### 2. Decision Summarization 💡
**Problem:** Can't remember what group decided  
**Solution:** AI captures consensus, shows decision card  
**Example:** Group agrees on carpool → "Bob driving 4, Carol 3"  
**Value:** Always know the plan, no repeated questions

### 3. Priority Highlighting 🚨
**Problem:** Urgent messages lost in casual chat  
**Solution:** AI surfaces critical messages with red indicator  
**Example:** "Pickup early, Johnny sick" → Jumps to top  
**Value:** Never miss emergencies

### 4. RSVP Tracking 📊
**Problem:** Manually counting who's coming to events  
**Solution:** Auto-track yes/no/maybe responses  
**Example:** "Count me in!" → Updates live tracker  
**Value:** Accurate headcount for food, transportation

### 5. Deadline Extraction ⏰
**Problem:** Forgetting permission slips, payment deadlines  
**Solution:** Extract deadlines, show countdown  
**Example:** "Due Friday 3pm" → "3 days remaining"  
**Value:** Zero late fees, zero parent guilt

### Bonus: Event Planning Agent 🤖
**Trigger:** "@ai plan Halloween party"  
**Process:** 5-step autonomous workflow

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Pivot Makes Sense

1. **Clear Value Proposition**
   - Old: "Another messaging app"
   - New: "Never miss what matters"

2. **Specific Target User**
   - Old: Generic user
   - New: Busy parent with 5-10 group chats

3. **Measurable Impact**
   - Old: Messages work
   - New: Zero missed events/deadlines

4. **AI That Helps**
   - Not "AI for AI's sake"
   - Each feature solves real daily problem
   - Parents will actually use this

### Why AI Features First

1. **Point Value:** 30 points (30% of grade)
2. **Independence:** Each feature stands alone
3. **Can Ship Incomplete:** 3-4 features = A grade
4. **Unique:** Differentiation from other projects
5. **Valuable:** Actually solves problems

### Risk Mitigation

**If AI takes longer than expected:**
- Build in priority order (Calendar first)
- Each feature is independent
- Can ship with 3-4 features
- Agent is bonus (10 pts, not required)

**If accuracy issues:**
- Extensive prompt engineering
- Test with real examples
- Confidence thresholds
- Manual trigger option
