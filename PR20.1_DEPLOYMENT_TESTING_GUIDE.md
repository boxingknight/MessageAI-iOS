## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. ✅ Firebase project: `messageai-95c8f`
2. ✅ Cloud Functions deployed
3. ✅ iOS app built for iPhone 17 simulator
4. ✅ Two test accounts registered
5. ✅ Group conversation created

---

### Test Case 1: High-Confidence Event Detection (Ambient Bar)

**Objective**: Verify that the proactive agent detects event planning and shows the Ambient Suggestion Bar.

#### Steps:
1. **Open the app** on iPhone 17 simulator
2. **Navigate** to a group conversation with at least 2 participants
3. **Send a message** with clear event planning intent:
   ```
   "Hey everyone, let's have a birthday party this Saturday at 3pm at my house!"
   ```

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Message appears in chat immediately
2. ✅ ProactiveAgentService triggers (check console logs: `🤖 New message detected...`)
3. ✅ Cloud Function analyzes conversation (10-15 second delay)
4. ✅ **Ambient Bar slides down from top** with:
   - Title: "Birthday Party"
   - Date: Saturday, [date]
   - Time: 3:00 PM
   - Location: "my house"
   - Participants: [group members]
   - Confidence badge: "90%" (or similar high value)
   - Primary button: "Create & Organize"
   - Secondary button: "Not Now"

#### Console Logs to Watch:
```
🤖 ProactiveAgentService: New message detected in conversation
🔍 AIService: Detecting opportunities for conversation: [conversationId]
✅ AIService: Found 1 opportunities
   Cached: false, Tokens: ~500, Cost: $0.0045
🤖 ChatViewModel: Handling 1 opportunities
🤖 High confidence (92%): Showing ambient bar
```

---

### Test Case 2: Approve Opportunity (Workflow Placeholder)

**Objective**: Test the approve button (currently simulates workflow).

#### Steps:
1. With the Ambient Bar visible from Test Case 1
2. **Tap** "Create & Organize" button

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Button shows loading spinner
2. ✅ Progress indicator appears
3. ✅ After 2 seconds (placeholder delay):
   - Ambient bar smoothly slides up and disappears
   - Opportunity dismissed

#### Console Logs:
```
🤖 ChatViewModel: Approving opportunity: Birthday Party
✅ ChatViewModel: Opportunity approved and processed
🤖 ChatViewModel: Dismissing opportunity: Birthday Party
```

#### Note:
In Phase 3, this will actually:
- Create the event in Firestore
- Send invitations to participants
- Set up RSVP tracking
- Track priority and deadlines

---

### Test Case 3: Dismiss Opportunity

**Objective**: Test the dismiss button.

#### Steps:
1. Trigger the Ambient Bar again (send another event message)
2. **Tap** "Not Now" button

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Ambient bar smoothly slides up and disappears
2. ✅ No further action taken
3. ✅ Console logs dismissal

#### Console Logs:
```
🤖 ChatViewModel: Dismissing opportunity: [title]
```

---

### Test Case 4: Caching Behavior

**Objective**: Verify that caching prevents redundant GPT-4 calls.

#### Steps:
1. Send an event planning message
2. Wait for Ambient Bar to appear
3. Dismiss the bar
4. **Wait 5 seconds** (within cache TTL)
5. Send a **similar** message (same event intent)
6. Observe console logs

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ First message: `Cached: false` (GPT-4 call made)
2. ✅ Second message: `Cached: true` (cache hit)
3. ✅ Cost: $0.0045 for first, $0 for second
4. ✅ Response time: ~10s for first, <1s for second

#### Console Logs:
```
// First message
✅ AIService: Found 1 opportunities
   Cached: false, Tokens: 512, Cost: $0.0045

// Second message (within 5 min)
✅ AIService: Found 1 opportunities
   Cached: true, Tokens: 0, Cost: $0.0000
```

---

### Test Case 5: Throttling

**Objective**: Verify that rapid messages don't trigger excessive Cloud Function calls.

#### Steps:
1. Rapidly send 5 messages (within 5 seconds):
   ```
   "Let's meet tomorrow"
   "How about 2pm?"
   "At the coffee shop"
   "Who's coming?"
   "Great, see you then!"
   ```

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Only **1 Cloud Function call** triggered (after 10s throttle)
2. ✅ Console shows throttle message for other messages
3. ✅ Cost savings: ~$0.018 (4 prevented calls)

#### Console Logs:
```
🤖 ProactiveAgentService: New message detected... (5 times)
⏳ ProactiveAgentService: Throttling - too soon since last analysis
⏳ ProactiveAgentService: Throttling - too soon since last analysis
⏳ ProactiveAgentService: Throttling - too soon since last analysis
⏳ ProactiveAgentService: Throttling - too soon since last analysis
🔍 AIService: Detecting opportunities... (only 1 call)
```

---

### Test Case 6: No Event Detected (Low Confidence)

**Objective**: Verify that casual conversation doesn't trigger the Ambient Bar.

#### Steps:
1. Send casual messages:
   ```
   "Hey, how are you?"
   "I'm doing great, thanks!"
   "What did you do today?"
   ```

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Cloud Function still analyzes (if throttle allows)
2. ✅ Returns confidence < 0.5 (or no opportunity)
3. ✅ **No Ambient Bar appears**
4. ✅ No inline chips or suggestions

#### Console Logs:
```
🔍 AIService: Detecting opportunities...
✅ AIService: Found 0 opportunities
   Cached: false, Tokens: ~300, Cost: $0.0027
🤖 ChatViewModel: Handling 0 opportunities
// No "Showing ambient bar" message
```

---

### Test Case 7: Medium Confidence (Inline Chips - Not Yet Implemented)

**Objective**: Understand behavior for medium confidence (0.6-0.8).

#### Steps:
1. Send a vague event message:
   ```
   "Maybe we should get together sometime next week?"
   ```

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Cloud Function returns opportunity with confidence 0.6-0.8
2. ⏳ **Inline chip NOT YET IMPLEMENTED** (Phase 3)
3. ✅ Console logs show medium confidence routing

#### Console Logs:
```
✅ AIService: Found 1 opportunities
   Confidence: 0.67 (67%)
🤖 Medium confidence (67%): Showing inline chip
// Note: UI not implemented yet
```

---

### Test Case 8: Lifecycle Management

**Objective**: Verify proper start/stop of proactive monitoring.

#### Steps:
1. Open a conversation (monitoring starts)
2. Check console for "Starting proactive monitoring"
3. Navigate **away** from the conversation
4. Check console for "Stopping proactive monitoring"
5. Navigate **back** to the conversation
6. Verify monitoring restarts

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Monitoring starts when chat view appears
2. ✅ Monitoring stops when chat view disappears
3. ✅ No memory leaks (listeners properly cancelled)
4. ✅ State cleared when leaving chat

#### Console Logs:
```
// On chat appear
🤖 ChatViewModel: Starting proactive monitoring for conversation: [id]

// On chat disappear
🤖 ChatViewModel: Stopping proactive monitoring

// On chat reappear
🤖 ChatViewModel: Starting proactive monitoring for conversation: [id]
```

---

### Test Case 9: Error Handling

**Objective**: Test graceful degradation when Cloud Function fails.

#### Steps:
1. **Temporarily disable internet** (Airplane mode)
2. Send an event planning message
3. Observe behavior

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Message still appears in chat (local optimistic update)
2. ✅ Cloud Function call fails silently
3. ✅ No Ambient Bar appears (no crash)
4. ✅ Error logged to console

#### Console Logs:
```
🔍 AIService: Detecting opportunities...
❌ AIService: detectOpportunities failed: The Internet connection appears to be offline.
🤖 ChatViewModel: Handling 0 opportunities
```

---

### Test Case 10: Multi-Event Detection

**Objective**: Test detection of multiple events in one message.

#### Steps:
1. Send a message with **two events**:
   ```
   "Let's have lunch on Tuesday at noon, and then meet for the project review on Thursday at 3pm in conference room B."
   ```

#### Expected Behavior:
1. ✅ Cloud Function detects **primary event** (lunch)
2. ✅ Returns highest-confidence opportunity
3. ✅ Ambient Bar shows first event details

#### Note:
- Current implementation prioritizes the **first/most confident** event
- Phase 3 could show multiple suggestions

## 💡 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Ambient Bar doesn't appear
**Possible causes**:
1. Low confidence score (<0.8) - check console logs
2. Throttling active - wait 10 seconds and try again
3. Cloud Function error - check Firebase Console logs
4. No internet connection - check network

**Solution**:
- Send a more explicit event message: "Let's meet Friday at 3pm at Starbucks"
- Wait for throttle cooldown (10 seconds)
- Check Firebase Console > Functions > Logs

### Issue: "INTERNAL" error in Cloud Function
**Possible causes**:
1. Missing OpenAI API key in Firebase environment
2. Firestore permissions issue
3. TypeScript compilation error

**Solution**:
- Verify `.env` file in functions/ directory
- Check Firebase Console > Functions > Logs for stack trace
- Redeploy: `firebase deploy --only functions`

### Issue: App crashes on approve/dismiss
**Possible causes**:
1. State management issue in ChatViewModel
2. Firestore listener not properly cancelled

**Solution**:
- Check Xcode console for crash logs
- Verify `stopProactiveMonitoring()` is called in deinit
- Rebuild and test: `Cmd+Shift+K` then `Cmd+R`
