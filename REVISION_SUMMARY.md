## 🎯 What's New: AI Features Pivot

### The Big Change: Busy Parent Persona

**Old:** No specific user persona  
**New:** Busy parents managing 5-10 group chats

**Why This Matters:**
- Clear, specific pain points
- Measurable value (missed events = bad)
- Personal/relatable (everyone knows a busy parent)
- AI features solve REAL problems (not gimmicks)
- Worth 30 points on the rubric

### 5 Required AI Features (15 points)

1. **📅 Calendar Extraction**
   - **Problem:** Missing events buried in messages
   - **Solution:** Auto-detect dates, one-tap add to calendar
   - **Value:** Never miss practice, games, events
   - **Example:** "Practice Thursday 3pm" → calendar event

2. **💡 Decision Summarization**
   - **Problem:** Can't remember what group decided
   - **Solution:** AI captures consensus automatically
   - **Value:** "Bob driving, Carol bringing snacks" always visible
   - **Example:** Group agrees on carpool → decision card

3. **🚨 Priority Highlighting**
   - **Problem:** Urgent messages lost in noise
   - **Solution:** AI surfaces critical messages
   - **Value:** "Pickup NOW" never missed
   - **Example:** Emergency → red indicator at top

4. **📊 RSVP Tracking**
   - **Problem:** Manually counting who's coming
   - **Solution:** Auto-track yes/no/maybe
   - **Value:** "5 yes, 2 no" live count
   - **Example:** "Count me in!" → updates tracker

5. **⏰ Deadline Extraction**
   - **Problem:** Forgetting permission slips, payments
   - **Solution:** Extract deadlines with countdown
   - **Value:** "3 days until payment due"
   - **Example:** "Due Friday" → deadline card

### Advanced AI: Multi-Step Agent (10 points)

**🤖 Event Planning Agent**
- **Trigger:** "@ai plan Halloween party"
- **Process:** 5-step autonomous workflow
  1. Analyze chat history
  2. Extract preferences
  3. Generate proposal
  4. Draft message
  5. Track responses
- **Output:** Complete event proposal ready to send
- **Value:** Saves dozens of back-and-forth messages
- **Technology:** LangGraph (required by rubric)

### Persona Fit & Relevance (5 points)

Clear mapping of features → pain points:
- Calendar → Date chaos
- Decision → Decision fatigue
- Priority → Priority blindness
- RSVP → RSVP confusion
- Deadline → Deadline stress

## 🔐 Technical Architecture Changes

### Added: Firebase Cloud Functions (Secure AI)

**Why Cloud Functions:**
- ✅ API keys secured (NEVER in iOS app)
- ✅ Rate limiting server-side (100 req/hour/user)
- ✅ Can update AI logic without app update
- ✅ Scales automatically
- ✅ Required by rubric for security

**Structure:**
```
functions/
├── src/
│   ├── ai/
│   │   ├── processAI.ts (main router)
│   │   ├── calendarExtraction.ts
│   │   ├── decisionDetection.ts
│   │   ├── urgencyDetection.ts
│   │   ├── rsvpExtraction.ts
│   │   ├── deadlineExtraction.ts
│   │   └── eventPlanningAgent.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── .env (API keys - NOT in git)
└── package.json
```

**iOS Side:**
```swift
// Simple, secure AI calls
let result = try await AIService.shared.processMessage(
    message,
    feature: .calendar
)
```

### Added: AI Data Models

**New Models:**
- `AIMetadata` - Attached to messages
- `ExtractedDate` - Calendar events
- `Decision` - Group decisions
- `UrgencyLevel` - Message priority
- `RSVPResponse` - Event responses
- `Deadline` - Action items

**Firestore Structure:**
```
messages/{messageId}/
  - text: string
  - aiMetadata: {
      extractedDates: [...]
      isUrgent: bool
      decision: {...}
      rsvpInfo: {...}
      deadlines: [...]
    }
```

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: AI Takes Longer Than Expected
**Mitigation:**
- Each feature is independent
- Can ship with 3-4 features if needed
- Calendar + Decision + Priority = most valuable
- Agent is bonus (nice to have)

### Risk 2: AI Accuracy Issues
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive prompt engineering
- Test with real parent chats
- Confidence thresholds (don't show low-confidence results)
- Manual trigger option for edge cases

### Risk 3: Running Out of Time
**Fallback:**
- **Minimum for A:** 3-4 AI features working well
- **Can defer:** Agent, some polish
- **Must have:** Calendar, Decision, Priority

### Risk 4: OpenAI Costs
**Mitigation:**
- Rate limiting (100 req/hour/user)
- Cache AI results in message metadata
- Only process new messages
- Function calling (cheaper than chat)
