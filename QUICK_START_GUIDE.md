## 💡 Pro Tips

### For AI Features
1. **Test with real examples**
   - Use actual parent group chat messages
   - Test edge cases
   - Iterate on prompts

2. **Show loading states**
   - AI calls take 1-2 seconds
   - Show "AI is analyzing..." indicator
   - Users need feedback

3. **Handle errors gracefully**
   - AI might fail occasionally
   - Provide manual trigger option
   - Don't block user if AI fails

4. **Cache results**
   - Store in message.aiMetadata
   - Don't reprocess same message
   - Saves API costs

### For Development
1. **Commit frequently**
   - After each feature works
   - Small, focused commits
   - Good commit messages

2. **Test as you go**
   - Don't wait until end
   - Two devices for testing
   - Real scenarios

3. **Ask for help early**
   - If stuck >30 min
   - Check Firebase Console logs
   - Review OpenAI Playground
